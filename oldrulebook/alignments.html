					<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Alignments</u></h2>
					<p>For every heart of good resides one of hatred. For every servant of chaos, there is a servant of law. The realm of Avorkarth's inhabitants 
					are many and varied, though all act accordingly, although loosely, to an alignment rule system. Such is the same for any created character.</p>
					<p>Alignments are the basis of a character's response and reaction to an event, and how they would perceive it to affect them.
					A law abiding character seeing a crime being done in front of them may try to stop it or inform the local guards while a more chaotic 
					character may chuckle and simply watch to see where this whole affair will go.</p>

					<p><i><b>Note</b> : Not all races are capable of any alignment, as it is a gift or curse that is mostly held by humanity. Many races
					in the beastiary have limiations due to their creators, gods and external influences throughout the ages. Remember that only a human
					reacts as a human.</i></p>

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Netural/True Neutral - "Seeker" </h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>There are two types of neutral characters, and the distinction between the two is important to note when creating a 
				neutral character for they are rather different.
				<br><b>Neutral</b> : Neutral characters only seek to continue living and are the most common type of character. They do not care that their actions
				fall between good or evil, law or chaos as long as they do not go hungry or thristy. Should a conflict occur, 
				neutral characters would seek the side that aids them the most.
				<br><b>True Neutral</b> : True Neutral characters seek the truth of all things, be it in the balance of the mind and heart, the mysteries 
				of the arcane
				or the secrets of life and death. They are the seekers, who do not judge but simply listen and learn. They are much rarer than traditional Neutral
				characters but they do not fall into the spectrums of law or heart.			
				</p>

				<br><br>
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Neutral Good - "Champion"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>Neutral Good characters seek to bring good and well-being wherever they travel. They treat others well, counsel and aid those in need and will go
				out of their way to do the right thing, as long as this does not bring harm to those close to them or that which they consider good. In times 
				of darkness,
				Neutral Good characters will voluntarily defend those who also follow the light, but are not entirely vindictive to those willing to repent, 
				accordingly letting live those who have done evil as long as they are punished accordingly.</p>		

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Neutral Evil - "Villain"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>Neutral Evil characters are those willing to do evil to further their own agenda. They seek to better their standing in life and are ready to do
				harm to others should it aid them in achieving this goal. Neutral Evil characters are quick to bargain and to scheme in the event of tragedy, seeking
				to aid themselves before anyone else can capitalize on the happenings. Characters of this alignment have no problem with evil acts as long as they
				gain something out of it, but will not gain extreme pleasure nor remorse from the action.</p>
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Lawful Neutral - "Judge"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>Lawful Neutral characters are those not easily swayed to good or evil and who act upon an iron moral code. These characters will listen and
				find their
				path upon the facets of information given to them, often making their decision based solely upon what knowledge is currently available. They usually
				do not act rashly, but they are surprisingly stubborn upon their decision once made, unless additional information comes to light. Whenever an event
				of destruction occurs, they will investigate to know what truly happened so as to make a proper judgement.</p>	
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Chaotic Neutral - "Whimsic"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>Chaotic Neutral characters do whatever they wish to, whenever it comes to them, without regard to the end destination or reward. Chaotic Neutral
				characters
				may seem to distrust authority, but it is more truthful to say that these characters are simply spontaneous and are given to a wider
				range of quick-minded thoughts which drift to individuality as well as freedom per person. Should a tragedy occur, these characters will often give 
				their skills to use, though as to why, none but the character can really say. Chaotic Neutral characters tend to be questioning, curious and whimsical,
				and with a dislike or rules and restrictions.</p>

				<br><br>
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Lawful Good - "Crusader"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>Lawful Good characters follow a given ruleset, be it divine scripture or a personal code, that tells of virtues. These characters are set in their 
				ways of good and will always aid those that are within their care, no matter the cost. They stand before darkness and evil always, their rules 
				guiding their every action. However, this also makes them hard to reason with, and a Lawful Good character will carry out their duty against 
				wrong-doers and creatures their code views as evil, their forgiveness very hard to gain.</p>
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Chaotic Evil - "Maniac"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>Chaotic Evil characters do whatever is upon their mind as long as it brings them pleasure or satisfaction regardless of any who are in the way
				of their current scheme. Unpredictable, Chaotic Evil characters are prone to simply be evil for the sake of being evil, without the need or reward
				of power or riches. These characters adore breaking rules and causing mayhem wherever they go and will do so at every turn, even turning on those
				who were allies mere moments ago. As such, these characters' schemes often do not last long nor work well as they so easily turn upon themselves.</p>				
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Lawful Evil - "Dominator"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>Lawful Evil characters are bound to rules that are of the nature of power. The strong dominates the weak, and the truly strong need not break
				their own ruleset to achieve such power. Tradition and loyalty are of great value to the Lawful Evil character, yet they do not understand mercy or
				kindness for they view it as a weakness. Lawful Evil characters understand that rulesets aid in keeping the structure of their might intact, but
				aren't beyond massacering what is necessary and will easily take pleasure in the pain of others to either gain more power or show their dominance.</p>
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Chaotic Good - "Renegade"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>Chaotic Good characters are individualistic beings above all. They view the idea of having rules wrong as their beliefs often tell them that
				not everything is cut and dry. These characters often will carry out what they believe is for the greater good, even should it bypass the laws
				in place and may be of benefit only in the moment of things. Though the hearts of chaotic good characters are kind and loving, they do
				not always agree with the larger picture or with the set rules if it harms or is unfair to another of their kind. Nonetheless, they would stand
				side by side with even Lawful Good characters against those of evil intent.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="page_inner_halfw">
				<br><br>

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">True Good - "Forgiver"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>True Good characters are often viewed as naive, for they are characters that will always seek the good in every encounter. These characters will
				go out of their way to aid everyone and everything on both sides of an argument, attempting even to bring those of darkest hearts to light. 
				Characters of True Good following will often lend a hand to anyone if simply asked or if they see that something is wrong, even often bringing pain
				upon themselves
				if it means helping another. They are easily tricked by evil characters, but sometimes their absolute kindness and gentleness softens and redeems 
				those of dark intent or turns the most hardened lawful character into one willing to stand with an enemy to face a greater threat.</p>
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">True Evil - "Destroyer"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>True Evil characters are exactly as their given title describes them. They seek pure destruction in all of its forms and have few other impulses or
				goals that drive their actions. Their purpose is single-minded, and that is to bring their own flaming vision of the world with no regard to anything or
				anyone else. Such characters are very far and few between, and while many would think that these characters are foolishly straight-forward, only their 
				goal is as such and many True Evil characters can be very manipulative in furthering their cause against life itself.</p>
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">True Lawful - "Zealot"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>True Lawful characters are beings bound to the laws given to them. They follow this rulest methodically and will never sway from it, no matter the 
				situation. As such, a True Lawful character is hard to associate with since they will not forgive even a single deviation from their code and
				will harsly deal out justice to any who would defy or cross the will of the code or being they serve. <p>
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">True Chaotic - "Fanatic"</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p>True Chaotic characters have abandonned reason, no longer abiding to laws or rules of any sort except their own. They are much like True Evil characters 
				in which they would erase all things living, yet would not replace it with their own vision as they have none. Characters that are of this alignment are 
				usually corrupted or taken over by a spell of madness. The few characters who are True Chaotic by nature tend to be followers of deities of insanity 
				and pandemonium, heading cults whose goal is to simply erase exsistance itself.</p>
