1217, Chapter of Eonna
</p>
<p class="setting">
"Night has fallen, the gentle rain still falling from the skies above and the day
has been a weary one. Glancing up to the darkened skies you know that this will
not end anytime soon and that perhaps a sheltered area would be of great comfort,
luckily you find yourself nearing a civilized settlement..."
</p>
<hr>
<p class="note">
For some reason or another, the player will have to place their character in the
starting area of the mini-campaign, the Sunrise Inn. The backstory of why is up
to the player’s character, though they need to choose between one of the following
general statements. Each character will arrive in their own times, with characters
rom A before B and so on.
</p>

<hr>
<p><b>A</b>.
The player has been travelling to aid Avanar having taken the main road through
Gateway Pass. The player begins with a map of the area, parts of the map uncovered
as well as basic knowledge of the bandit troubles and the silence of Avanar.
</p>
<p class="setting">
You find yourself caught in the light downpour of rain, the raindrops trickling
upon the leaves above and bringing a quiet peace to the land. The few guards posted
at Gateway Pass had told you to be weary, as bandits were seen harassing travellers
on the road and the villagers of Attenbur further north. Looking down at the ragged
map that was taken from the messenger board, you note that you should be reaching an
Inn ahead by the name of “The Sunrise Inn”, which is known for its delicious salted
roast pork. Peering up from your map, you see a swaying sign up ahead with faded
paint depicting a half-risen sun.
</p>

<hr>
<p><b>B</b>.
The player is travelling to a personal destination without knowing of the troubles.
They may choose to have been travelling from the south-west through Gateway Pass,
from the west having left the village of Attenbur or from the north-east by
Mirrowmere Lake’s famed bridge. The player begins with a map, parts of the map
uncovered, as well as one of the optional knowledges below.
</p>
<p class="setting">
It was curious that the main roads and even the many pathways less travelled from
Karthia to Araloth had led you to so many encounters. As the rain kept descending
upon the muddied and unkept stone road, you slip and catch yourself upon a nearby
branch. As your eyes glance up, you notice that you’ve finally arrived at a cozy
inn built upon an intersectional pathway. This may be a good place to stay the night.
</p>

<p><b>B1</b>
-(If you travelled westward by Mirrowmere lake.) Relief passes through you as you
finally see a hint of civilization after many weeks of travel, and though the
forested area was tranquil, it was nice to see a lively inn.
</p>

<p><b>B2</b>
-(If you travelled north-eastward by Gateway Pass.) The guards had told you to be
weary due to bandits harassing travellers as well as bringing trouble to the
villagers of Attenbur further north.
</p>

<p><b>B3</b>
-(If you travelled eastward from the village of Attenbur.) Though you did not
stay long at “The Fuming Cup”, you overheard a few of the villagers whispering
in fright of rising bandit troubles on the east road and how no guards had arrived
from the northern garrison nor from Gateway Pass. Shrugging it off, you nonetheless
prepared yourself for trouble as you struck out east the next morning.
</p>

<hr>
<p><b>C</b>.
The player is simply seeking shelter for the night, having taken a wrong turn and
now travelling northwards. The player begins with a few tiles uncovered and a
landmark, but no map of the area.
</p>
<p class="setting">
The shortcut that the old man had given you seemed so sure, so easy. Now, lost
within the woods, you only find solace in the quiet peace that rain brings to the
wilds and the fact that predators rarely hunt in such conditions. As you pass
‘round the next bend of the barely visible trodden dirt path, you look up in
astonishment as you find yourself at the edge of the wilds, the forest becoming
thinner just as it had by that lonesome, but impressive ruined tower a few days back.
Your ears perk as you hear laughter and talking down the path, and you catch a
glimpse of an orange light dancing on a dangling sign up ahead...
</p>

<hr>
<p><b>D</b>.
The player is simply there and filled with curiosity following a water path from
the north.  (Non-human characters, most likely nature/fey or elemental based,
but can be used for beast-like characters as well). The player begins with a few
tiles uncovered, but no map of the area.
</p>
<p class="setting">
The rain was beautiful, the feeling of water upon your skin felt refreshing and
cleansing. The rushing waters of the rivers that you had tracked since deeper,
wilder lands steered your path as you playfully followed its twists and turns,
passing by waterfalls, an ancient ruin and a shimmering lake. This was almost
enough to miss the sudden intrusion as you hear laughter and strange voices
coming from up ahead. Peering carefully through the brush, you see a multitude
of strange beings with small rounded ears sitting within this built structure
in front of an unspreading, roaring fire. Sadly, they had cut and destroyed part
of the forest, strangely reinforcing their triangular shelters. Gathering up your
courage, you decide to approach a bit closer.
</p>

<hr>
<p><b>E</b>.
The player is deeply wounded and in desperation seeks the aid of the races that
might hunt it. (Non-human/beast-like humanoid characters that usually hunt humans
like certain feyfolk, were-creatures, sirens or harpies. Begin at 1/5th hit and
health points.) The player begins with nothing more than their own inventory.
</p>
<p class="setting">
The rain did not help as you dragged yourself to the shore of the river, pain
throbbing in your abdomen where the predator had latched on with their claws and
bitten deep. You slowly force yourself ahead as you know that these are not fully
wild forests, the flesh and iron beings by the name of humans having made their
mark a long time ago. Desperately and ever so slowly, you stumble through the woods,
with every shadow making you turn in terror… As you head deeper in the forest,
keeping to the shadows, you see a glimmer of light to the north. Humans.
Though their murderous and dangerous kind frightens you to the very core,
you know that in your weakened state, they may be the only chance of not being
eaten by other predators this night.
