<h2>THE PASS OF RADELL</h2>
<h4 class="centered">Game Master</h4>

<p>LOCATION : LEGARA, KARTHIA || FORAGE DC : 9

<h3 class="encounter">1. Campfire/Cart</h3>
<p>
The campfire is the first thing the players would see as it flickers in the night
and its light illuminates the clearing.. A horse-drawn cart is behind it, having
stopped in the clearing and a human sits on a log laid beside the fire.
</p>
<p class="skill-check">
<b>SPOT CHECK | DC : 4</b><br>
It would seem that the cart has broken down, one of its wheels having been
splintered and hacked apart. The cart itself seems to be carrying trade goods,
although those with a good eye will note that the goods have been ransacked
and quite a few of the linen bags are torn open.
</p>
<p class="skill-check">
<b>TRACK CHECK | DC : 5</b><br>
There are larger tracks, inhuman and while smaller than human tracks, definitely
has a humanoid feel. This can then lead to a knowledge nature/geographical check
of DC : 5, to note that they are kobolds.
</p>

<h3 class="encounter">2. Old Merchant - Olfred Vendal</h3>
<p>
Olfred Vendal is an old Karthian travelling merchant who had taken the Pass of
Radell to move to the next town over and continue his ambling ways. Typical to
most humans, he is weary of the Pass, but does not believe in inhuman creatures,
nor their having taken residence in the caves, that is until he and his daughter
were attacked by a group of kobolds.

<p class="skill-check">
<b>SPOT CHECK | DC : 4</b><br>
Those who pass this check will Olfred seems very distraught, gripping his head
and staring blankly into the fire as his mind seems to be panicking.
</p>
<p>
If the players decide to speak to Olfred, he'll shakily welcome them to the fire
as long as they are human. As with most Karthians/humans, he is very superstitious
and will be ever more weary the more inhuman the player is. (This does include
more common inhumans such as falgrii, runnoc and so on.) Once questionned he'll
answer that he and his daughter were ambushed by small creatures of reddish skin
with long arms, floppy ears and sharp teeth.
</p>

<p class="skill-check">
<b>KNOWLEDGE : NATURE | DC : 5</b><br>
The creature is known as a kobold.
</p>

<p>
He'll then beg the players to rescue his daughter, and if possible to regather
his goods. If asked for payment he'll try to bargain his way out, being a
merchant at heart, first offering goods such as rations, and the rest of his
stock if pushed or intimidated. If asked to join the players, he'll pale and
refuse but can be inspired to join if it is a critical success.
Olfred will also sell torches to players who ask for them, but can be easily
convinced to give them for free.

on it, but instead of will give 1 silver piece to each player.
</p>


<h3 class="encounter">3. Horse</h3>
<p>
A brown, mid-aged horse is attached to the cart and seems to be calm. Its ears
are still twitching a bit, catching nearby sounds. It will react passively to
any humanoid player character, but can be easily frightened by predatory creature
player characters.

<p>
Players with animal affinities can effectively hire the horse to help the players
should any combat occur, otherwise it'll simply stay at the camp. If the players
somehow bait the kobolds out of the cave, the horse will at charge them.
</p>

<h3 class="encounter">4. Cave Entrance</h3>
<p>
The cave's entrance is eerie and while it is wide, it is rather small and requires
creatures of medium size to crawl into and for creatures of large or large needing
of break their way through somehow. Little light passes through this small opening.
</p>

<h3 class="encounter">5. Secret Passage</h3>
<p>
Spot Check DC : 7 | Listen Check DC : 6<br>
Blended into the rocks is a thin crack that reveals itself to be an alternate
route and a direct passage to the kobold's prison. Soft sounds of a woman
sobbing can be heard through. (This is the merchant's daughter.)
</p>

<h3 class="encounter">6. Kobold Guard</h3>
<p>
A singluar male kobold guards the entry way, an iron barred gate shut behind him.
He holds the key to the gate, and if engaged directly will call upon his two
allies further down.

<h3 class="encounter">7. Iron Gate</h3>
<p>
An iron gate bars the pathway of the tunnel. It has a rusted, but functional,
lock keeping it shut. If a character has a strength value of 9 or more, they
may bend/rip the bars open.
</p>

<h3 class="encounter">8. Kobold Guards (2)</h3>
<p>
Two more kobold guards hold the room and seem to be salivating as they look upon
their female karthian prisoner. Each kobold also holds a key to the lock of the gate.
They will call upon the outside guard if players appear in the hidden tunnel.
The kobold outside the tunnel will take 1 turn to open the gate with the key.
</p>

<h3 class="encounter">9. Merchant's Goods</h3>
<p>
A few bags of basic items (to be determined) are laying upon the ground.
It would seem that the kobolds took as much as they could. In addition to a
coin value of 2 gold pieces, 12 silver pieces and 43 copper pieces, there are also... :

Should players appear from either side and are no longer fighting or negotiating
with the kobolds, she will run up to the humanoid character with the highest beauty.
If the saving player is a creature character, she will instead back up fearfully
and will need to be persuaded or forced to follow.

<p>
If she feels unafraid, she'll urge them to run away, as there were more kobolds
that had attacked the cart, but she didn't see where they went.

<p>
A lodged boulder is in the way with a painted red streak. It is easily moved
