				<hr>
				<p>The number costs of the language show how much mastery is required to learn the language to that level. These are with the idea of an intelligence 7 character. Each point of intelligence beyond reduces the mastery rank required, and each point of intelligence lower increases the mastery rank required.</p>

						<tr><th></th><th colspan="4">Costs</th><th></th></tr>
						<tr><th>Language</th><th>Understand</th><th>Speak</th><th>Read/Write Simple</th><th>Read/Write Complex</th>
						<th style="width:50%;">Description</th></tr>

						<tr><th colspan="6">Very Common</th></tr>
						<tr><th>Karthian</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>The most common language now spoken, it is the most simplistic and direct at conveying information. Even those not of the central lands have used it for trade and venture.</td></tr>

						<tr><th colspan="6">Common</th></tr>
						<tr><th>Dwalai</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>The language spoken by the humans of the sands and dunes of Sharas. Other than perhaps Karthian, it is by far the most spoken language of trade.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Tildar</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>The harsh language of the Tildran people. Due to their current status as a human sub-species, Tildar is viewed as the language of the slave class.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Skord</th><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>The language of the northern Thrakan, it is a language wonderful at embelleshing and adding details to ever aid the great sagas sung in the halls of greater men.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Xing</th><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>The flowing language of the Xia humans is like its land. It is soft and complex, full of philosophy and mystery, with certain words able to mean many things depending on the context of the phrase.</td></tr>

						<tr><th colspan="6">Odd</th></tr>
						<tr><th>Orcish</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>This guttural language is the lowest form of demonic and cannot express many complex ideas quickly. It is surprisingly well developped for any combat or warlike situation.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Delnen</th><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>Delnen is the precursor language of Karthian and is still used by Karthan clergy for their prayers and litanies. Only the Daelden of the south still use this elder language as a means of everyday communication.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Nareth</th><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>A simpler version of the past language of Silden, the Narei decided to change their language to be more open to others after leaving the Golden lands as to create allies in their surroundings.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Runic</th><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>The Runnoc language is the most valued and important aspect of their culture as it shapes their whole way of life. Their language is very direct and rule based, for from language comes rules and runes which in turn gives civilization and therefore might.</td></tr>


						<tr><th colspan="6">Rare</th></tr>
						<tr><th>Silden</th><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>The beautiful language of an elder age, the true words of ancient Silden are forgotten but by a very few. It is still used as a spoken language by Aelvenkin, although without its true power.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Treant</th><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>The living trees fel the whispers of sylvan long ago and learnt to copy a rough, slow, groaning variation of it over the eons.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Ignan, Terran, Auran, Aquan + Other Elemental languages</th><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>These strange sounds are often mistaken for simply trying to recreate the sounds of nature itself.</td></tr>


						<tr><th colspan="6">Fabled - requires magical aptitude to speak</th></tr>
						<tr><th>Faeic</th><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>The quick whispering language of the small fae-folk. To those who do not understand it, it is like a small chime, often mistaken for a sound in the wind.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Draconic</th><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>22</td><td>Too proud in their ancient days of old to use the then language of sylvan, the dragons were the first to create a language of their own. For this pride, it is deep, loud and unmistakably royal.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Necril</th><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>24</td><td>The language of the dead, even the mortals that use it know that every word feels innately wrong to speak.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Celesital</th><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>25</td><td>The ringing, clarion words of those who serve and are born of holy magic.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Daemonic</th><td>11</td><td>16</td><td>21</td><td>26</td><td>This deep, yet lyrical language is used by the creatures and servants of the five halls.</td></tr>

						<tr><th colspan="6">Mythical - requires magical aptitude to understand more complex ideas</th></tr>
						<tr><th>Sylvan</th><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>The soothing, musical language created from primal gods and astrals for the Sei'yuulei and their allies is able to shape or even create life itself. It is naturally understood by all creatures which have not closed their heart to nature, at least to convey a general guidance/feeling.</td></tr>
						<tr><th>Abyssal</th><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td><td>The language of ancient evils is dark, dreary and feels as if one is drowning while speaking it.</td></tr>
