<h2>LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>
The number costs of the language show how much mastery is required to learn the
language to that level. These are with the idea of an intelligence 7 character.
Each point of intelligence beyond reduces the mastery rank required, and each
point of intelligence lower increases the mastery rank required.

	<tr><th>Karthian</th>
        <td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td>
        <td>The most common language now spoken, it is the most simplistic and
            direct at conveying information. Even those not of the central lands
            have used it for trade and venture.</td></tr>

	<tr><th>Dwalai</th>
        <td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td>
        <td>The language spoken by the humans of the sands and dunes of Sharas.
            Other than perhaps Karthian, it is by far the most spoken language
            of trade.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Tildar</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td>
        <td>The harsh language of the Tildran people. Due to their current status
            as a human sub-species, Tildar is viewed as the language of the slave
            class.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Skord</th><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td>
        <td>The language of the northern Thrakan, it is a language wonderful at
            embelleshing and adding details to ever aid the great sagas sung in
            the halls of greater men.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Xing</th><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td>
        <td>The flowing language of the Xia humans is like its land. It is soft
            and complex, full of philosophy and mystery, with certain words able
            to mean many things depending on the context of the phrase.</td></tr>

	<tr><th colspan="6" class="centered">Odd</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Orcish</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td>
        <td>This guttural language is the lowest form of demonic and cannot express
            many complex ideas quickly. It is surprisingly well developed for any
            combat or warlike situation.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Delnen</th><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td>
        <td>Delnen is the precursor language of Karthian and is still used by
            Karthan clergy for their prayers and litanies. Only the Daelden of
            the south still use this elder language as a means of everyday
            communication.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Nareth</th><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>9</td>
        <td>A simpler version of the past language of Silden, the Narei decided
            to change their language to be more open to others after leaving the
            Golden lands as to create allies in their surroundings.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Runic</th><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td>
        <td>The Runnoc language is the most valued and important aspect of their
            culture as it shapes their whole way of life. Their language is very
            direct and rule based, for from language comes rules and runes which
            in turn gives civilization and therefore might.</td></tr>

	<tr><th colspan="6" class="centered">Rare</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Silden</th><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td>
        <td>The beautiful language of an elder age, the true words of ancient
            Silden are forgotten but by a very few. It is still used as a spoken
            language by Aelvenkin, although without its true power.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Treant</th><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>13</td>
        <td>The living trees fel the whispers of sylvan long ago and learnt to
            copy a rough, slow, groaning variation of it over the eons.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Ignan, Terran, Auran, Aquan + Other Elemental languages</th>
        <td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td>
        <td>These strange sounds are often mistaken for simply trying to
            recreate the sounds of nature itself.</td></tr>

	<tr><th>Faeic</th>
        <td>9</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>18</td>
        <td>The quick whispering language of the small fae-folk. To those who do
            not understand it, it is like a small chime, often mistaken for a
            sound in the wind.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Draconic</th>
        <td>10</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>22</td>
        <td>Too proud in their ancient days of old to use the then language of
            sylvan, the dragons were the first to create a language of their own.
            For this pride, it is deep, loud and unmistakably royal.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Necril</th>
        <td>10</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>24</td>
        <td>The language of the dead, even the mortals that use it know that
            every word feels innately wrong to speak.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Celesital</th>
        <td>10</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>25</td>
        <td>The ringing, clarion words of those who serve and are born of
            holy magic.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Daemonic</th>
        <td>11</td><td>16</td><td>21</td><td>26</td>
        <td>This deep, yet lyrical language is used by the creatures and
            servants of the five halls.</td></tr>

	<tr><th colspan="6" class="centered">Mythical - requires magical aptitude to understand more complex ideas</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Sylvan</th>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>20</td><td>26</td><td>32</td>
        <td>The soothing, musical language created from primal gods and astrals
            for the Sei'yuulei and their allies is able to shape or even create
            life itself. It is naturally understood by all creatures which have
            not closed their heart to nature, at least to convey a general
            guidance/feeling.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Abyssal</th>
        <td>15</td> <td>20</td><td>30</td><td>40</td>
