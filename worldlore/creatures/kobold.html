<h2>KOBOLD - DRIKID</h2>
<p class="centered">SMALL HUMANOID</p>
<p>
<img src="../../images/worldlore/creatures/Kobold.jpg" style="width:35%;" align="right">
These small pack hunting humanoids are commonly mistaken for evil fae-folk and
have been the cause of many wrongful superstitions. Whether or not this is true,
their tendencies of kidnapping their food as well as their fascination of treasures
and an odd fixation on candles seems to match the tales told. While they somewhat
resemble goblins and giblins in appearance, though with deep red skin,
they are not of orcish heritage and are nearer akin to trolls.
</p>

<h3>KOBOLD CULTURE</h3><hr>
<p>
Kobolds live in tribal patriarchal packs, with males being the diggers, workers, crafters
and hunters, and females being cooks and mothers. The homes of kobolds are always in
natural caves that have been expanded and dug out to fit the growth of the tribe. While
kobolds live for short years comparative to humans, they also reproduce a bit faster.
This often leads to kobold tribes taking over an area, usually nearing human settlements
that they may plunder during the night or ambush solo travellers.
</p>

<h3>KOBOLD RELIGION</h3><hr>
<p>
While kobolds are deeply superstitious, they are not religious per say. They bicker and
argue amongst themselves as to who or what their god is, often it being a local creature
of great power such as a drake or giant that they sacrifice to. Being diggers, 
Kobolds also sometimes take into consideration odd structures and geological foundations
as great signs or gods in slumber. This varies per clan, and each tribe has its own
great god or pantheon of gods.
</p>

<h3>KOBOLD DIMORPHISMS</h3><hr>
<p>
The male and female of the kobold species are similar to humanity in their
differences, although to a much lesser extent. Males are of stronger build by nature,
while females are slightly weaker. Beyond this, they are very
much alike in their mind and abilities.
