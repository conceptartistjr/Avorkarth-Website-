<h2>AELVENKIN - NAREI</h2>
<p class="centered">MEDIUM HUMANOID</p>

<p>
The eldest remaining civilization of the fourth age, the aelvenkin, or elves as
named by humanity, had discovered sun based arcanic manipulation and harnessed
its secrets to create their rule. This age ended after thousands of years of
opulence when they failed to stop their own insane lust for power and the
unfortunate mastery of blood magic. The revolt of the lower class along with the
greatest invasion of the southern dark orcs tribes of the age split their species
thin and led to the destruction of most of their ancient civilization.
</p>

<p>
The most common of all aelvenkin, and now often mistakenly thought by other races
as the true elves, the narei are the descendants of the slave class that once
served the noble houses. They fled south from their ancestral once the great
houses of the Sanguinnar turned to blood magic. The Narei gave up the crystal's
blessing of incredibly long life and ability enhancements, no longer tying their
young to the ancient crystalline magics, knowing the dangers of such power.
Narei are often relaxed and openminded, ready to accept others into their fold,
as their past teaches them that life can be hard when one is treated poorly.
</p>

<h2>NAREI CULTURE</h2>

<p>
Narei have been changing and evolving their culture ever since they left their
ancestral golden lands. Wandering from land to land, their kind finally settled
upon uninhabited forests near both the Karthian and the Falgrii. Using all adopted
cultures they had met in their travels, the Narei created a small kingdom of their
own to shelter their kind. As such, the Narei culture very much resembles that of
the adaptive Karthians, though with less account for personal weatlth and power.
Ruled by a line of kings, they are nonetheless advised by an elected council,
keeping to the ideal that every voice should be heard.

<h2>NAREI RELIGION</h2>
<p>
The religious beliefs of the Narei is founded upon the olden ways of their ancestors.
It was said that long before the crystalline discoveries, the Aelvenkin worshipped
Arenya much like humanity. Many Aelvenkin, including Narei, still have a hard time
believing this as the tales of Ashna, the Eternal King are still revered and they
hope that he shall reawaken to reunite all Aelvenkin back to their glory of old.
</p>

<h2>NAREI DIMORPHISMS</h2>
<p>
The male and female of the aelvenkin species are similar to humanity in their
differences, although to a greater extent. Males are of stronger build by nature,
while the female is much more slender and graceful. Beyond this, they are very
much alike in their mind and abilities.
