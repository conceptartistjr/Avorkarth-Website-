<h2>HUMAN - THRAKAEN</h2>
<p class="centered">MEDIUM HUMANOID</p>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>
Humans are not the eldest, nor the strongest, nor the most agile of races,
yet they are the most common upon the continents. This is due to the fact that
humans are flexibly adaptive to most environments and opportunities, harshly
judge those that are not alike and spread really, really quickly. Add to that
a suprisingly high potential for great minds, and humans have risen to create
a dominant civilization upon the central lands of the realm.
Humanity has survived many ages but their history has often been rewritten,
destroyed and simply forgotten due to their warlike tendencies. Since their age
dawned many millenia ago, humanity spread and split into many variants, each
evolving depending on their settled area.
</p>
<p>
Far up in northern mountainous highlands of Thrakean live the mighty barbarians.
Taller and often stronger than other human variants, they are known for their
natural physical prowess. These skaalds and warsingers, sons and daughters of
the winters and conquerors of the highlands might not seem to have much of a
civilization compared to Karthians, but their clans know that the lands should
not be fully tamed. Should one ask a Thrakaen what matters most, they would say
that would be one's personal valor and deeds.

<h3>THRAKAEN CULTURE</h3><hr>
<p>
Thrakaen society is based upon honour in battle and where the highest honour
one can have is to die defending a friend or a hearth. Warring clans and villages
would often bury and chant the fallen dead of both allies and foes at the end of
conflict for their bravery upon the bloody snow. Thrakaen clans are lead by an
elected chieftain, often the wisest or the strongest amongst them.
</p><p>
Though once the clans warred and battled amongst themselves, the Karthian invasion
half a decade ago united many of them and they were successful at pushing the
legions back to a standstill. At the war's end, Thrakaen's culture was split
into two, as were their lands. Most clans have chosen peace and more and more
follow the ways of Karthia, while a few remaining northern clans hold to the
wilds and fight still, ready to reclaim their ancestral homes when the time returns.
</p>

<h3>THRAKAEN RELIGION</h3><hr>
<p>
Thrakaen respect deeds of valor above all things, and their beliefs reflect this.
They worship the fallen dead with chants of their stories and heroic deeds,
calling to their pantheon of gods to let the brave feast within the halls of Oderyn.
Thrakaen also respect and pray to various spirits of nature, their myths filled
tales of such creatures, but they don't consider them gods, merely as powerful
creatures that carry out the will of the pantheon above.
The rise of Eonna's worship has also emerged from the southern most clans who
trade with the new Karthian footholds. This is met with more resistance the
further north one goes, where the old traditions still hold sway.

<h3>THRAKAEN DIMORPHISMS</h3><hr>
<p>
The male and female of the human species have very slight differences,
other than their visual distinctions. Males are of slightly stronger build by
nature, while the female tends to be more slender and graceful, although both
are able to ascend and surpass one another in these regards. Beyond this,
they are very much alike in their mind and abilities.
