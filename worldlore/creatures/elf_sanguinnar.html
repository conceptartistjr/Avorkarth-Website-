<h2>AELVENKIN - SANGUINNAR</h2>
<p class="centered">MEDIUM HUMANOID</p>

<p>
The eldest remaining civilization of the fourth age, the aelvenkin, or elves as
named by humanity, had discovered sun based arcanic manipulation and harnessed
its secrets to create their rule. This age ended after thousands of years of
opulence when they failed to stop their own insane lust for power and the
unfortunate mastery of blood magic. The revolt of the lower class along with the
greatest invasion of the southern dark orcs tribes of the age split their species
thin and led to the destruction of most of their ancient civilization.
</p>

<p>
The tall, fair and elegant aelvenkin are the visual representation of immortality. 
Powered by their cystalline implant, the unaging fair-folk of the golden lands used 
the ancient discovery of crystalline arcanic magics to make their lives one of opulence
and decadence. Still millenia after the fall of the aelvenkin empire, their last 
remaining cities of gold and crystal seem nothing short of invincible, the secrets 
of their powers having long been kept to themselves.
</p>

<h2>SANGUINNAR CULTURE</h2>

<p>
The last remaining cities of the Sanguinnar are still those of opulence and decadence. 
They mostly ignore the outside world, their high priests clouding their minds with the
lies that all is still well, and that their immortality is given freely. Most 
Sanguinnars know where the flow of endless blood comes from, but their culture views
all others as necessary sacrifices and is reflected in their arrogant demeanors. 
While a few Sanguinnars have since come to like their less advanced allies, some even
forgiving the Narei and Sildaen treachery, most lie upon the dreams of their once 
great empire and will do anything, including sacrificing allies, simply so that 
they may live on and be one of the chosen upon the Eternal King's return.

<h2>SANGUINNAR RELIGION</h2>
<p>
The Sanguinnar's belief is centered around the return of the Eternal King. Their newly
arisen God had, at the height of his power ages ago, paved the way for their glorious
empire upon golden lands, removing the lesser human and orcish kind who had begun 
to encroach. The Eternal King gave them immortality and power in the form of crystal
and left secrets in the form of blood for those who had the willpower to do so. The
Sanguinnar believe it is their houses' rule to make the return of the Eternal King,
even at the cost of their own kind.
</p>

<h4>RELIGION - ASHNA, THE FIRST KING</h4>

<h2>SANGUINNAR DIMORPHISMS</h2>
<p>
The male and female of the aelvenkin species are similar to humanity in their
differences, although to a greater extent. Males are of stronger build by nature,
while the female is much more slender and graceful. Beyond this, they are very
much alike in their mind and abilities.
