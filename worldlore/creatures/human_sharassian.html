<h2>HUMAN - SHARASSIAN</h2>
<p class="centered">MEDIUM HUMANOID</p>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>
Humans are not the eldest, nor the strongest, nor the most agile of races,
yet they are the most common upon the continents. This is due to the fact that
humans are flexibly adaptive to most environments and opportunities, harshly
judge those that are not alike and spread really, really quickly. Add to that
a suprisingly high potential for great minds, and humans have risen to create
a dominant civilization upon the central lands of the realm.
Humanity has survived many ages but their history has often been rewritten,
destroyed and simply forgotten due to their warlike tendencies. Since their age
dawned many millenia ago, humanity spread and split into many variants, each
evolving depending on their settled area.
</p>
<p>
The human inhabitants from the dunes to the south are known as the Sharassians
and are the proud descendants of an ancient empire lost to the sands of time.
Sharassians have long lived in harsh deserts and biting winds of dust, having
made habitable land the richest of treasure and of more value than the ideal of
being king or emperor. Though easily accepted into other culture's larger cities
as traders and merchants bearing strange artifacts, their darkened skin is still
quite a curiosity to most outside of Sharas.

<h3>SHARASSIAN CULTURE</h3><hr>
<p>
The Sharassian civilization is known to have been raised upon puzzles and secrets,
and a Sharassian's love for a riddle or is said to nearly rival that of a Sphinx's.
Sharassian's are often cautious and questioning, always seeking to know the entirety
of the problem before striking a deal. For the most part, they are a trade-based
people with few major cities and many travelling camps that do the desert dunes.
Like Karthians, Sharassians are a united people should a threat arrive, but
otherwise the lure of controlling a life-giving oasis or a rocky shaded crag that
shelters from the environment has often touched upon base human greed and want.
</p>

<h3>SHARASSIAN RELIGION</h3><hr>
<p>
The harsh deserts often lead to Sharassians asking their many Gods for help and
guidance. Each Divine has an aspect that they control and oversee, though are
all under the laws of Orsir, Lords of Sands, savior of the Sharassian culture
when their ancient cities were swept under the sands. Orsir rules alongside a
council of three other major deities, but is supported by hundreds of other
minor deities. As such, the worship of any deity isn't as strange to Sharassians
as they believe that there is perhaps another facet of a phenomenon which is
controlled by an unknown minor God or Goddess.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, another prevailing Goddess in Sharas; Skressis, she whom is
presumed dormant. Deep in the Vildaar desert lies the bones of a massive serpent
which towers over the dunes. The bones are impossible to chip with any known
tools of iron or steel and as such has gathered worship over the centuries,
the priests chanting that only the faithful will live when Skressis awakens to
end this age.
</p>

<h3>SHARASSIAN DIMORPHISMS</h3><hr>
<p>
The male and female of the human species has very slight differences, other
than their visual distinctions. Males are of slightly stronger build by nature,
while the female tends to be more slender and graceful, although both are able
to ascend and surpass one another in these regards. Beyond this, they are very
much alike in the mind and abilities.
