<h2>HUMAN - XIA</h2>
<p class="centered">MEDIUM HUMANOID</p>
<p>
Humans are not the eldest, nor the strongest, nor the most agile of races,
yet they are the most common upon the continents. This is due to the fact that
humans are flexibly adaptive to most environments and opportunities, harshly
judge those that are not alike and spread really, really quickly. Add to that
a suprisingly high potential for great minds, and humans have risen to create
a dominant civilization upon the central lands of the realm.
Humanity has survived many ages but their history has often been rewritten,
destroyed and simply forgotten due to their warlike tendencies. Since their age
dawned many millenia ago, humanity spread and split into many variants, each
evolving depending on their settled area.
</p>
<p>
In the far eastern misted lands of Jian, the human variation known as Xia take
residence in philosophical harmony. Xia are known for their reverence of respect,
beauty and above all, balance in all things, as taught to them millenia ago by
the being known as the First Heavenly Emperor. It is said that if one observes
a Xia, they can feel a strange aura of life and purpose in their every action.
The Xia will respond that it is their way to respect ki, the force that lives
in all things and makes them whole.
</p>

<h2>XIA CULTURE</h2>
<p>
Xia's culture is very much an odd one to most other human variations as it
hinges mostly on philosophy and wonder. Questions asked can go through debates
for centuries before simply being left alone, becoming another of the thousand
mysteries of Jian. The Xia's reverence of respect is also obvious as even the
most hated of Xia brethren will often speak to one another before they act upon
the more primal instincts of warfare. This makes it very strange for the more
straightforward races to live alongside the philosophical Xia, their direct
questions toyed with and tossed around only for a hundred different answers to
fall from the heavens above, each a plausible solution.
</p>

<h2>XIA RELIGION</h2>
<p>
The Xia religion is the worship of the spirits of the land. These can manifest
in just about anything, and almost everything has a spirit associated with it.
Xia therefore mostly pray and give offerings to the spirit that watches over
their part of the land, known as a Land God. Spirits however, are not all
benevolant. The Xia therefore seprerate spirits into two categories, the Ki'tzai
(Kind Spirit) that watch over humanity and nature, and the Ki'tzau (Evil Spirit),
known to eat human souls and care only for themselves. Yet above all Land Gods,
spirits and men, there are supposedly five great Spirit Gods, watching the very
balance of Jian itself and each taught their ways by the august First Heavenly
Emperor, breather of life.

<h2>XIA DIMORPHISMS</h2>
<p>
The male and female of the human species has very slight differences, other than
their visual distinctions. Males are of slightly stronger build by nature, while
the female tends to be more slender and graceful, although both are able to ascend
and surpass one another in these regards. Beyond this, they are very much alike
in the mind and abilities.
