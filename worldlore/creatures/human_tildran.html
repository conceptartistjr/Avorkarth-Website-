<h2>HUMAN - TILDRAN</h2>
<p class="centered">MEDIUM HUMANOID</p>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>
Humans are not the eldest, nor the strongest, nor the most agile of races,
yet they are the most common upon the continents. This is due to the fact that
humans are flexibly adaptive to most environments and opportunities, harshly
judge those that are not alike and spread really, really quickly. Add to that
a suprisingly high potential for great minds, and humans have risen to create
a dominant civilization upon the central lands of the realm.
Humanity has survived many ages but their history has often been rewritten,
destroyed and simply forgotten due to their warlike tendencies. Since their age
dawned many millenia ago, humanity spread and split into many variants, each
evolving depending on their settled area.
</p>
<p>
The western humans living in the rocky regions and mountainous crags between
Legara nd the emerald seas are seen as barbaric and of lesser kin, mostly due
to their culture of witchcraft and primal blood-led rituals. Due to this reputation,
more than half of the Tildrans were enslaved and slaughtered when the Karthians
expanded Legara's empire. Few free Tildrans remain, most now serving their
Karthian masters, but the clans that do have entrenched themselves and have grown
more bloodthirsty against outsiders.

<h3>TILDRAN CULTURE</h3><hr>
<p>
The Tildrans have long centered their culture around covens of what most would
call witches, with each tribe having a matron council that advises a single
chosen male warlord. Bones, blood and flesh have great meaning to Tildrans and
it is not uncommon for a Tildran to keep dried bone of previous family members
on them at all times. However, after their great loss against the Karthian empire,
many are struggling against being indoctrinated by the Karthian so-called civilized
manners and are forgetting their spiritual origins. With this turn, even many tribes
have cast out the olden ways and are forsaking the eldritch spirits of their ancestors,
believing them to be weak. This rift has caused many tribes to fight one another,
adding onto the already warring tribal warlords simply seeking domination,
further weakening their last roots against the Karthians.
</p>

<h3>TILDRAN RELIGION</h3><hr>
<p>
Religion is split within the Tildran people. The first is their coven worship of
the eldritch beings, those that bestow their great powers to the a few chosen
witches that guide the tribe. Those creatures of blood and death are heavily
worshipped by the more free and traditional Tildran, and a few of the slaves
in the Karthian empire seeking to escape or rebel. The second, which is stronger
the closer the tribe is to the edges of Tildran land, is the similar worship of
the Karthians, being the Holy Light of Eonna and her three archangels.

<h3>TILDRAN DIMORPHISMS</h3><hr>
<p>
The male and female of the human species has very slight differences, other than
their visual distinctions. Males are of slightly stronger build by nature, while
the female tends to be more slender and graceful, although both are able to
ascend and surpass one another in these regards. Beyond this, they are very much
alike in the mind and abilities.
