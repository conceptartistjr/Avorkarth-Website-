<h2>CREATION'S TIMELINE</h2>

<p class="caption">---- Once again, this is a work in progress, things might change.----<p>

<h4>PRIOR TO CREATION - ASTRALITY(? Years before the Fifth Age)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Twin Divines, Yshae and Sylhael wake and sing, creating an existence of
    purity and harmony within the void.
</li>
<li>From its essence, the Twin Divines' voices creates beings of great power,
    Astrals, each with their own voice and aspect to add to the song.
</li>
<li>As the chorus grows in strength, its far reaching echo creates its opposite,
    which mimics the song as a screech, creating an undescribable creature who
    only ever wishes to remove existence and silence the song, who births the Nameless.
</li>
<li>So begins the first conflict, the Astral War, as the Nameless attempt to
    destroy any related to the song of creation.
</li>
<li>While the conflict lasts a seeming eternity, some Astrals are corrupted and
    turn upon their creator, turning the tide against the Twin Divines.
</li>
<li>In a move of desperation, the Twin Divines force their creation into becoming
    a material thing, quieting the song and hiding it from the Nameless, creating
    and cradling Y'syl, the realm of creation.
</li>
<li>While most of the Nameless dissipate from this act, many still seek the
    origination of these echoes of the Great Song, and they still hold sway over
    many Astrals who are unknowingly corrupted.
</li>
</ul>


<h4>FIRST AGE - DISHARMONY (~2,800,000 Years before the Fifth Age)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Twin Divines bring the first six and greatest Astrals to aid them in
    creating life upon this new physical realm of creation, to keep things protected
    and in balance. These six are : Kerethar, the voice of growth; Anaeila,
    the voice of tears; Arenya, the voice of hope; Atronach, the voice of might;
    Ulgath, the voice of silence; Tilvaer, the voice of dreams.
</li>
<li>With the aid of the Six, the first four beings of matter and physical substance
    are created. Four elemental gods, each with a portion of the material plane to
    govern and watch. Yshae, with the aid of Kerethar, Anaeila and Arenya creates
    the watchers of Air, Sel'tya, and Water, Yul'tae. Sylhael, with the aid of Atronach,
    Ulgath and Tilvaer, creates the watchers of Fire, Feo'rag and Earth, Gor'kan.
</li>
<li>Content, the Twin Divines leave the realm be and return to the eternal war,
    to continue protecting their creating from the darkening void.
</li>
<li>However, their voyage is betrayed and seen by fallen Astrals and the void
    quickly strike at the realm of creation.
</li>
<li>The elementals, working together and creating armies of their own, repel
    the invasion and erect a powerful barrier around the entire realm.
    This takes too long however, and the elemental watchers feel the corruption
    of the void upon their actions. It takes little time for them to turn upon
    each other, wanting the realm of creation for themselves alone.
</li>
<li>The World Shattering conflict occurs as the elements clash for supremacy
    over the material plane, creating oceans and continents.
</li>
<li>The Twin Divines return to find Y'syl shattered and at war. They reluctantly
    step in, creating mortal forms of themselves that can reside within and
    influence the realm.
</li>
<li>They banish the Elemental watchers into their own realms, removing their
    direct actions upon the realm of creation.
</li>
<li>To protect their realm once more, the Twin Divines ask two of the Six,
    Anaeila and Kerethar, to also shed their Astral forms and to walk and watch
    over the realm. Anaeila and Kerethar create mighty beings to aid them in
    guiding the realm. Arenya through her astral animal spirits and Kerethar
    through living matter with ancient and mighty tree-beings.
</li>
<li>Atronach, the warrior and most powerful of the Six alongside Kerethar,
    feels saddened by the Twin Divines' refusal to choose him as one of the
    great helpers. His discordant emotions drive him to come down in full power
    without the aid of the Twin Divines, shedding his Astral form. He creates
    age immortal creatures from his own flesh and mind, calling them daemons.
</li>
<li>The Twin Divines, though concerned by his choice, are not one to destroy.
    They accept his decision and aid him in shaping a part of the world from
    himself and his creations. They also ask the other three Great Astrals in
    creating guiding creatures.
</li>
<li>Arenya creates the Angelic Host, and their leaders, the six archangels.
    Ulgath creates reapers of dread robe and silent voice, and Tilvaer creates
    ever more complex creatures of unliving matter and mechanical marvel.
</li>
<li>The Daemonic Council settles, forming five great houses to honour different
    aspects of life. Valor, Patience, Harmony, Beauty and Generosity.
</li>
<li>In time, many other of the lesser Astrals choose and ask to help shape the
    mortal song and bring in servants of their own.
</li>
<li>The first mortal creatures begin shaping under the Twin Divines' song as the
    world stabilizes. The first dragons as well as the ancestors of hydras, drakes,
    even the early humans.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>SECOND AGE - CORRUPTION (~300,000 Years Ago)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first crude civilizations appear as time goes by. Many are watched over
    by Astrals, who are viewed and praised as spirits or gods, others are guided
    by elemental hand.
</li>
<li>Among the civilizations, two go beyond the the simplicities of life.
    The first are the insectoid hive-minded Ikkani, far to the south and whose
    cultural advancements are far beyond any other. The other are the Sei'yuulei,
    the first fae, in the central and northern lands, who discover an attunement
    to the harmony that shapes the world, and who begin to attempt to add their
    own voices to its echoes.
</li>
<li>The Twin Divines hear this strange, childlike note to the harmony of their song,
    and watch the Sei'yuulei from a distance. They are surprised to find that the
    Sei'yuulei are indeed feeling the tug of the song of the world. Curious and
    ecstatic at the race's innate ability, they call upon Anaeila and Kerethar to
    leave the rest of the realm to the other lesser Astrals to watch over and
    teach the Sei'yuulei to use the great song, even if their mortal forms only
    allow a lesser degree.
</li>
<li>Anaeila becomes known to the Sei'yuulei as the Great Huntress, alongside her
    astral animals, led by the astral lynxes, while Kerethar becomes known as the
    Great Defender, alongside his ents and living forests.
</li>
<li>Atronach, also curious, offers his help to his brother and sister and is
    gladly welcomed.
</li>
<li>The daemonic council ally themselves to the Sei'yuulei and aid in teaching the
    young race.
</li>
<li>Thanks to the gift of the Twin Divines and guided by the Huntress, the Defender
    and the Council, the Sei’yuule begin forming a pact with the life coursing
    through the forests and the ancient beasts roaming the wilds.
</li>
<li>While this happens, the Ikkani empire finds a different teacher. They find
    a tear that had been created by the first war with the nameless. Their high
    priests are slowly twisted and corrupted by the void beings and begin creating
    an empire, quickly spreading and devouring lesser races and cultures that stand
    in theirs and their masters’ path.
</li>
<li>The conflict known as the Eternal War begins its first as the Ikkani clash
    with their first foe of equal might. Working together, the Sei'yuulei and the
    creatures of nature under their wing hold back their first waves. However,
    dark ominous whispers guide the hand of the Ikkani, and it takes little time
    for them to begin conquering and slaughtering settlements.
</li>
<li>The Sei'yuulei turn their full attention to the war and alongsdie the might
    of the masters of the five halls and nature's fury they turn the tide back
    in their favour and push the Ikkani all the way back to their first cities.
</li>
<li>Driven to the brink of insanity and with little left of their once great empires,
    the Ikkani priesthood stretch and rip open more of the tear to the void,
    finally allowing Nameless upon the realm of creation.
</li>
<li>The Nameless take on forms that defy natural laws, and with powers of incredible
    destruction. They also bring a new weapon to the realm of creation, necromancy,
    capable of raising those fallen into new servitude, teaching this to the
    Ikkani Priesthood.
</li>
<li>The appearance of the nameless and the powers of necromancy changes the aspect
    of the war, and the allied forces are swiftly pushed back.
</li>
<li>The Nameless slowly start exanding the tear to the void and calling one of
    the three lieutenants of the Void, Z’rass’i’in, the Mind of Insanity,
    into the realm.
</li>
<li>In return, the elemental watchers offer their aid upon their most hated enemies.
    Although they are still behind the walls of their own realms, the elemental-based
    creatures join the Sei’yuule. Leviathans, Couatles, Hapries, Sirens and many
    others join the cause to defend the realm as the elements of wind, earth, fire
    and water lend their aid, their hatred of the beings that once attacked before.
</li>
<li>The three remaining Great Astrals also aid, although not part of the realm by
    sending in their most powerful personal servants.
</li>
<li>Eventually, an avatar of Z'rass'i'in makes its way through the rift and begins
    corrupting the ideals of the Daemonic Council. Though it is defeated by Atronach,
    it succeeds in planting a touch of insanity into the former astral warrior’s mind.
</li>
<li>The war continues, and Atronach and the daemons who serve him get ever more deadly,
    underhanded and bloodthirsty. Atronach himself grows ever more deranged.
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, on the brink of victory, Atronach’s mind falls completely to
    Z’rass’i’in’s corruption and turns his hosts against its once allies as well
    as the Ikkani, intent on simply destroying everything to get a peace of mind
    and no longer be influenced by anything.
</li>
<li>The Daemonic Council is now a warped and corrupted image of what it used to be.
    Honour becomes Pride, Patience loses its way to Sorrow, Harmony falls to Wrath,
    Beauty transforms to Lust and Generosity takes everything back, becoming Greed.
</li>
<li>A few of the Daemonic Council refuse to follow and are almost all slaughtered,
    finding refuge within the realms of the Sei’yuule, aiding and struggling to
    resist the call of destruction.
</li>
<li>Yshae and Sylhael return as the tides turn for the worst, sadly locking their
    once great warrior away into a prison realm alongside his Daemonic Council.
    This realm is beautiful and plentiful for their kind, but is quickly corrupted
    by a deranged Atronach as it becomes a place of hellfire, torture and suffering.
</li>
<li>While the betrayal and loss of Atronach’s daemons forces the Sei’yuule’s forces
    to split their attention, the Ikkani are able to push out their foes and
    successfully summon Z’rass’i’in to the realm.
</li>
<li>Z’rass’i’in appears and the realm trembles and falls to shadow and the battle
    between it and the astral warriors changes the face of the realm. The retaliation
    of the Ikkani's new ruler easily stretches out to most corners of the realm.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>THIRD AGE - MORTALITY (~110,000 Years before the Fifth Age)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The land is covered in darkness, the Sei'yuulei and their allies pushed out
    of the midlands and their homelands. Mortal species and races band together
    to fight back against darkness, but with little hope as the realm begins to
    crumble apart. Luckily, most mortal species in hiding are ignored as Z'rass'i'in
    focuses everything upon the favourite race of the Twin Divines. The astrals'
    creations do their best to keep and guard the hiding mortals, while the fae,
    elemental and natural forces alongside remaining kind daemons focus on slowing
    the advances of the Ikkani and shadows.
</li>
<li>At the very last city of the Sei’yuule in the far north there is one final
    effort by the Sei’yuule, the remaining allied Daemonic Council members,
    a few Astral warriors and the forces of the Natural world manages to fend
    off Z’rass’i’in’s cult and its armies long enough for Yshae and Silhael to
    sacrifice most of their wordly forms, locking the creature away into a
    prison at the very bottom of Y’syl.
</li>
<li>The Twin Divines are forced to hide and rest apart from one another to hide
    from the remaining cults, leaving the fate to the mortal races and astral
    warriors. They gift Kerethar and Anaeila with one last power, a mighty seed,
    that should grow a tree that grants protection to a large area of choosing.
</li>
<li>Yshae goes back to rest in the Sei’yuule lands under the guise of a moon-lit
    doe and Sylhael in a part of the midlands as a long golden serpentine dragon.
    He wanders for a few centuries alongside chosen uncorrupted astral beings who
    aided him in the war into the realm of creation before disappearing, teaching
    them to guard the balance of all things. This land becomes Jian, and its
    creatures are touched with Sylhael’s divine power, allowing them to sense
    life itself, which is later named Ki.
</li>
<li>To heal and ward the last remnants of life, the gift of the Twin Divines is
    planted at the heart of the remaining Sei’yuule civilization, far from their
    once great cities of the middle lands.
</li>
<li>The last of the war rages on for millennia, but in the end the nameless are
    driven from the realm of creation and the Ikkani are banished to the far
    corner of the realm, their few remaining cities buried and kept in stasis
    under a powerful spell, sealing the rift caused tens of millennia ago.
</li>
<li>The cost of the war has been great and the Sei’yuule number a few hundred,
    their great cities and lands destroyed, devoid of life except for the
    sanctuary lands near the great tree in the far north. Most knowledge of the
    past is gone and the few who remain that remember the previous age seal and
    any knowledge as for it to never happen again. Almost all is forgotten,
    except through tales and whispers.
</li>
<li>The Sei’yuule pledge to defend the last preserves of song-life, the far
    northern forests beyond the seas and icy flows and keep a watchful eye on
    Y’saurui, the Great Tree, as well as the prison of the great shadow while
    preserving what knowledge is left of their ancient ways.
</li>
<li>The land where the clash between the astral warriors and Z’rass’i’in happened
    becomes a barren land incapable of growing life. Its rocky spires of ash and
    dust that lead to Z’rass’i’in’s prison become known as the Blackened Spires,
    and separates the sei’yuule forests from the rest of the realm.
</li>
<li>The remnants of the war torn lands south of the Blackened Spires slowly regain
    life as races that had hid or fled retake their lands. These destroyed and
    forgotten lands are simply called the Midlands. (Later named Avorkarth by
    the Aelvenkin.)
</li>
<li>Anaeila and Kerethar call upon two of the other powerful Astral Warriors to
    aid these lands in their stead. Arenya agrees to watch over the grace of the
    light and Ulgath, the permanence of death. They gift these watchers the
    midlands, and all agree to keep the Sei’yuulei’s lands and the imprisoned
    one beyond the frozen wastes secret.
</li>
<li>Arenya, true to her word and power of light helps form many creatures’ paths.
</li>
<li>Ulgath in turn simply wanders, keeping the dead as they are and hunting any
    signs of necromancy but otherwise staying his hands away from the mortal ways.
</li>
<li>Many of the other Astrals who helped shape early civilizations remain as well,
    some still pure, some secretly corrupted. Though they are bound by the Twin
    Divines to keep the past a secret, some let slip some dark tales and stories.
    They are also still considered Gods by the simple mortals and become worshipped,
    creating a myriad of cultures.
</li>
<li>Mortals, being so easily swayed, also follow some ancient beings or creatures
    from the first age such as dragons or colossi, creating even more cultures.
</li>
<li>What is known as the first age of records happens, and the wars that blacken
    and ravage the land are fierce and many as corrupted Astrals lead their chosen
    mortals in conquests against one another...
</li>
</ul>

<h4>FOURTH AGE - SILENCE (~68,000 Years before the Fifth Age)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The ages of the Aelvenkin empires and the Runnoc, alongside the the start of
    humanity's first great kings. Barbarism is commonplace amongst all races as
    they vie for their place in the realm.
</li>
<li>The Aelvenkin empire falls upon itself due to the rise of the Sun King and
    the discovery of blood magic. The Sanguinnar have a short but mighty rule
    before crumbling due to infighting.
</li>
<li>Humanity takes the opportunity of the fall to start spreading.
</li>
<li>Daemonic invasion happens sometime in the later years of the age, leading to
    the disappearance of Arenya. Eonna takes over the angelic council in
    temporary position.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>FIFTH AGE - HOPE - THE CURRENT AGE - (~3,500 years before and including the Tale of the Fifth Age)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Humanity has mostly wiped out everything in the midlands and have cemented
    their place. Most wars are now in between humans.
</li>
</ul>
