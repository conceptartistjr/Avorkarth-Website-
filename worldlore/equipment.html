</p>

<p>
Equipment is the one of the most, if not the most, necessary thing to have whilst
on an adventure and can be the literal bread and butter of an adventurer. Clothes,
food, backpacks, weapons, rope, maps, you name it, it's for sale on a merchant's
shelf somewhere in the realm. Equipment is divided into multiple categories and
are all listed within tables that show the the cost, weight and descriptions/rules.
Some items are unique to certain cultures and have restrictions as to which race
can use it, or are much harder to acquire.
</p>

<h3>Monetary Currency (Human Kingdoms)</h3>
<p>
The civilized cultures throughout the realm of creation sell equipment for any
and all adventurers through a form of trade, most commonly seen as currency and
the most common among them the humain coin based one.
</p>
<p>
Although the coins throughout the realm all have their different stampings,
varying from kingdom to kingdom, the material they are made with are kept common
so that all kingdoms, empires and peoples can trade at equivalent value.
It takes 100 of a lesser coin to equal a greater one.
(100 copper coins is equal to 1 gold coin).
</ul>
<li>
    <b>Copper/Iron Pieces (Cp)</b> : The most common and most used of all coinage.
    Copper pieces are used mostly on a the day to day basis, as a small meal or a
    item usually comes down to a couple of coppers. An average labourer's wage is
    between 2 to 3 copper pieces a day, enough to keep oneself fed.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Silver Pieces (Sp - 5 Cp)</b> : A less common coin, silver pieces are
    used more commonly to trade items of greater worth. This coin is seen more
    commonly in areas of greater trading such as cities and capitals.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Gold Pieces (Gp - 100 Cp)</b> : Thees rarer coins in somewhat common
    use and even a few gold will be enough to live comfortably for a year or two
    within populated villages. Low end servants will usually be within the gold
    ranges, as would good weaponry.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Diamond/Platinum Pieces (Dp - 10,000 Cp)</b> : These platinum coins or
    gold coins with a cut diamond core will by themselves purchase anything anyone
    would need to live and is mostly used by the upper class. Special weaponry and
    armours are sold at seedy auctions at this price, as are high end butlers,
    exotic pets and slaves of certain qualities. If one has platinum in their pocket,
    they are considered to be of very rich.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Anyar Pieces (Ap - 1,000,000 Cp)</b> : These specially marked coins of a
    shimmering white metal are used and kept by royalty, guild leaders or the
    ridiculously wealthy. Each anyar piece is more a favor trading marker than
    a currency, as it can be used to finance exploration ventures or small
    personal armies.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Item/Equipment Material Quality</h3>
<p>
Equipment and many usuable items of metallic base can be made of different material
types. This makes quite a differnce for not only their quality but also their costs.
The most commonly used metal is bronze and is the base cost of the item that every
other quality is derived from.
</p>
<p>
<b>Breaking Point/Durability (optional)</b> : Some items will have a breaking check,
which is how many critical failures the player must roll on attacks in a row or
at once for the item to break. Armour and shield durability is decreased instead
by opponent critical hits.
</p>

<h3>Masterwork Items</h3>
<p>
Should an item or equipment have the masterwork trait within their title,
it is a rare item of exquisite craftsmanship and is of greater quality than any
other within its material type. These have a small bonus though at a doubled
cost increase.
</p>
<p>
<b>Masterwork Weapons</b> : These are perfectly balanced and have an almost
unnatural ease of handling. Masterwork weapons give an additional +1 to +3
bonus to their Attack value.
</p>
<p>
<b>Masterwork Armour/Shields</b> : These are made with just the right amount of
materials to give a good defense without burdening the wielder. The weight of
the armour/shield is reduced by half and the Armour Penalty is reduced by 1 to 3.

<p>
<b> Weapon Type</b> : Weapons are split into three weapon types :<br>
-- <b>Crushing(C)</b> : Smashing weapons such as hammers, good at striking large surfaces.<br>
-- <b>Piercing(P)</b> : Weapons with a fine end, able to pierce their target.<br>
-- <b>Slashing(S)</b> : Weapons with a bladed edge, allowing for elegant movements.</p>

<b> - Weapon Range</b> : The maximum reach of a weapon. If a weapon has a range,
    then it cannot be used in direct melee properly. Unless specified, the user
    takes a -2 on their attack values and weapon might in melee with ranged weapons.
<b> - Throwable</b> : If a weapon has the throwable keyword, it may be thrown up to 5
    + Strength distance.
<b> - Weapon Carry Size</b> : Single-handed weapons are standard size and two-handed
    weapons are large size, even if used or wielded.
<b> - Weapon Size</b> : Creatures must wield weapons of their own size.
    Each size difference from Medium increases or decreases on might by 1,
    doubling per size category further and halves or doubles the cost and the weight.
    It also changes the carry size category by 1.
