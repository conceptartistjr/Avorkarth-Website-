					<h2 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:0;"><u>Equipment</u></h2>	
					
					<p>Equipment is the one of the most, if not the most, necessary thing to have whilst on an adventure and can be the literal
					bread and butter of an adventurer. Clothes, food, backpacks, weapons, 
					rope, maps, you name it, it's for sale on a merchant's shelf somewhere in the realm. Equipment is divided into multiple categories and 
					are all listed within tables that show the the cost, weight and descriptions/rules. Some items are unique to certain
					cultures and have restrictions as to which race can use it, or are much
					harder to acquire. These are often found in the Lore book instead.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Monetary Currency (Human Kingdoms)</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The  civilized cultures throughout the realm of creation sell equipment for any and all adventurers 
					through a form of trade, most commonly seen as currency and the most common among them the humain coin based one.</p>

					<p>Although the coins throughout the realm all have their different stampings, varying from kingdom to kingdom, the material they are 
					made with are kept common so that all kingdoms, empires and peoples can trade at equivalent value. 
					It takes 100 of a lesser coin to equal a greater one. (100 copper coins is equal to 1 gold coin).</p>
					
					<p><b>- Copper/Iron Pieces (Cp)</b> : The most common and most used of all coinage. Copper pieces are used mostly on a the day to day
					basis, as a small meal or a item usually comes down to a couple of coppers. An average labourer's wage is between 2 to 5 copper pieces a day, 
					enough to keep oneself fed.</p><!--1 copper = 20 bucks-->
					
					<p><b>- Silver Pieces (Sp - 5 Cp)</b> : A less common coin, silver pieces are used more commonly to trade items of greater worth.
					This coin is seen more commonly in areas of greater trading such as cities and capitals.
					
					<p><b>- Gold Pieces (Gp - 100 Cp)</b> : The rarer coins in somewhat common use, even a few gold will be enough to live comfortably
					for a while within outskirting villages. Low end servants will usually be within the gold ranges, as would good weaponry.
					</p>
					
					<p><b>- Diamond/Platinum Pieces (Dp - 10,000 Cp)</b> : These platinum coins or gold coins with a cut diamond core
					will by themselves purchase anything anyone would need to live and
					is mostly used by the upper class.  Special weaponry and armours are sold at seedy auctions at this price, as are
					high end butlers, exotic pets and slaves of certain qualities.
					If one has platinum in their pocket, they are considered to be of very rich.</p>
					
					<p><b>- Anyar Pieces (Ap - 1,000,000 Cp)</b> : These specially marked coins of a shimmering white metal
					are used and kept by royalty, guild leaders or
					the ridiculously wealthy. Each anyar piece is more a favor trading marker than a currency, as it can be used to finance exploration ventures or
					small personal armies.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Starting Currency</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>While most races would have their own currencies and approximate values within the human realms, humans themselves have the 
					following approximate starting coinage.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align:center;">Weapons and Armor</h3>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Weapon Types</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Weapons have three different types, each depicting a possible way of inflicting damage to their wielder's foe. Crushing,
					Piercing or Slicing. While it doesn't always come into effect, some creatures are much harder to defeat with certain types
					of weaponry. <i>(Skeletons, for example, due to having a empty core body
					have a special rule that gives them additional bonuses against piercing attacks.)</i></p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Masterwork</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Should a weapon or armour have the masterwork trait within their title, it is a rare item of exquisite craftsmanship and is
					of greater quality than any other within its material type. These have a small bonus though at a doubled cost increase.</p>
					<p><b>Masterwork Weapons</b> : These are perfectly balanced and have an almost unnatural ease of handling. Masterwork
					weapons give an additional +1 to +3 bonus to their Attack value.</p>
					<p><b>Masterwork Armour/Shields</b> : These are made with just the right amount of materials to give a good defense without burdening
					the wielder. The weight of the armour/shield is reduced by half and the Armour Penalty is reduced by 1 to 3.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Item/Equipment Material Quality and Size</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					
					<p>Equipment and many usuable items can be made of different material types. This makes quite a differnce for not only their quality
					but also their costs. The most commonly found armor or weapon is made of bronze and is the base cost of the item. Other qualities
					costs are shown below.</p>

					<p><b>Breaking Point/Durability</b> : Weapon will have a breaking
					check, which is how many 1s the player must roll on attacks in a row for the item to break. Armour and shield durability is decreased 
					by 1/10th of the damage taken before armour reductions. (If the damage is lower than 10, durability isn't reduced.)
					
					<!--<p><b>Breakable</b> : The Wood, Copper, Brass and Bronze/Stone item qualities can break with misuse. Weapon will have a durability
					check, which is how many 1s the player must roll in a row for the item to break. The armours' durability is decreased every time
					the player is critically hit.-->
