<h2>KNOWLEDGE SKILLS</h2>
<p>
Knowledge skills are much like the trade skills in that they all share the same
difficulty check. Unlike trade skills however, knowledge skills don't have a
choice for their difficulty check and instead function like normal skills in
that the knowledge in question is the difficulty check.
</p>

<p>
Knowledge skills can overlap as well, and any creature may roll all the knowledge
skills they think will give information and are not limited to rolling a single
knowledge skill per query. Each knowledge facet will give different answers.
</p>

<h3>KNOWLEDGE SKILLS</h3>

<table class="skills">
<tr><td> Skill            </td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td> Description      </td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td> Checks           </td><td> Once per knowledge</td></tr>
<tr><td> Difficulty Check </td><td> Per query.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Armour Penalty   </td><td> No </td></tr>
<tr><td> Combat Uses      </td><td> None  </td></tr>
<tr><td> Additional       </td><td> See below.</td></tr>
<tr><td> ---------------- </td><td>   </td></tr>
<tr><td> Critical Success </td><td> The knowledge is well known to the creature.  Gain an additional piece of information for free.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Success          </td><td> The queried knowledge is satisfied and known.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Partial Success  </td><td> The knowledge is somewhat known, but the answer known is vague at best.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Fail             </td><td> The knowledge is unknown.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Critical Fail    </td><td> The character thinks the answer is something that is not even relevant.</td></tr>

<h3>SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE - REGION </h3>
<p>
<b>Very Similar</b> : Creatures may attempt Knowledge : Region checks for sub-skills
a similar aspect, such as a Knowledge : Nature check for a different region of
desert, although with a -2 penalty
</p>

<p>
<b>Somewhat Similar</b> : Knowledge skills that share a bit of a similar aspect,
like a river to a lake, take a -4 penalty.
</p>

<p>
<b>Barely Similar</b> : Knowledge skills that are too different but still in the
same sphere, such as knowledge of deserts versus knowledge of forests
take a -7 penalty.
</p>

<h3>SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE - RACE</h3>
<p>
Same sub-race : Creatures may attempt Knowledge : Race checks for unknown races
of the same species (human variation against another human variation), although
with a -2 penalty
</p>

<p>
<b>Known species</b> : If the species are known to one another but not of the same
species (humans and aelvenkin), the penalty is instead -4.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conflicted species</b> : If the races are known to one another but not in good
standing (humans and goblinkin), the penalty is dropped to -7.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unknown/Mythical species</b> : If the species barely know or are unknown to one
another (humans and faefolk), the penalty is -10.
</p>

<h3>SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE - MAGIC</h3>
<p>
<b>Different Sphere</b> : Creatures may attempt Knowledge : Magic checks for
spheres other than their own, although with a -5 penalty.
