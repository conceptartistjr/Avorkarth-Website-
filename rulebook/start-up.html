					<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Start-Up</u></h2>
					<p>Welcome to Avorkarth, a role-playing game set in a realm of low-fantasy adventure. 
					This rulebook will aid players in setting up a role-playing session (campaign), based within the realm of Avorkarth. Such sessions are
					controlled by a designated player known as the Game Master and whose role is to make the world interact with the 
					created avatars of the remaining players.</p>
					
					<p>The rulebook also sets boundaries to make the realm of avorkarth as immersive a world as possible, giving the players an understanding
					of the comparative lore and setting they find themselves within.
					Long time table-top players may find that this game is not quite as mechanically balanced as similar table-top games out there, with the hope 
					of being more immersively balanced.</p>
					
					<p>Each section of the rulebook will tend to a specific set of rules that defines what the player's character is and what actions 
					or choices their character may take. If it is the first time that a player will enter into the realm of Avorkarth, 
					it is highly recommended they read the rulebook even if they've played other similar tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
					
					<h3 style="text-align: center;">BASE REQUIREMENTS</h3>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Players (recommended: 3 to 7)</h4> 
					<hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The players of Avorkarth are separated into two categories.
					<br><br><b>Game Master (GM)</b> : A single player takes the role of arbritator for the current
					and future sessions, known as the Game Master. Their role is to control all non-player characters, creatures and challenges and
					are in charge
					of creating and/or setting the adventure that the remaining players will go through. 
					<br><br><b>Adventurers</b> : The remaining players each
					control a single character, usually of their own creation, and are tasked with finishing and beating the goal given by the Game Master
					by the means available to their characters. Unlike most table-top games, Avorkarth campaigns should and will be written to be able
					to be beaten in many ways, not simply through combat.</p>

					<br><br>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Area of Play</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Avorkarth is based upon traditional paper and pencil roleplaying games, and as such may be fully played 
					as long as players have access to six-sided dice or a dice-rolling program, and a method of jotting down notes and information such
					as a tablet or pen and paper.</p>
					
					<p>While playing around a table with friends is an incredible experience,
					it is also entirely possible to play with others from around the world using online voice-chat systems, and there are even many websites
					and digital programs dedicated to recreating table-top like experiences.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0;">6 Sided Dice</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Avorkarth uses 6 sided dice as its main playing component, with rolling dice representing the randomality of life for most 
					characters' actions.
					Should a character wish to jump, charm, sooth, tend, attack or 
					do any other action in which the result is not wholly predictable, they would roll the required amount of dice
					and be told by the Game Master to let them know if they succeeded. <!--When a rule says 1d6, it means to roll one six-sided die.
					Rules such
					as 1d2 or 1d3 can be viewed as rolling the dice then dividing it as required. 
					<br><i>E.g. : (1d2 means that a dice result of 1, 2 or 3 is 1 and a dice result of 4, 5 or 6 is 2.)</i>--></p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Adventurers - Character Sheets</h3><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Players who take on the role of the adventurers will create and take control of a single character, 
					an avatar of their will within the realm. These characters do not necessarily represent
					the player themselves, but rather are a character of their own imagination. They can have their own personality, their own set of skills,
					strengths or weaknesses of completely unrelated note to their player. This rulebook is set and organized
					to guide players into creating their very own character which shall adventure though the Game Master's story, and to understand
					the related rules to playing the game.</p>
