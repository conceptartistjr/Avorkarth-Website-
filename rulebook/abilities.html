<h1>ABILITY SCORES</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
Ability scores are the core representation of every creature's general aptitudes
represented as statistics for various facets such as their might, swiftness,
bravery, balance and so on.
</p>
<h3>Ability Score Categories</h3>
<p>
Abilities are split into distinct categories. These are the Essential, Physical, Mind and
Social abilities, each governing a part of the character's whole. The details
for each is detailed below and on the further pages.
</p>

<table>
<tr><td width="33%;"> <b>Essential</b>   </td><td> Wounds, Constitution, Vitality </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Physical</b>    </td><td> Strength, Agility, Dexterity </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Mind</b>       </td><td> Instinct, Intelligence, Willpower </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Social</b>      </td><td> Wisdom, Charisma, Elegance </td></tr>
</table>

<h2>ESSENTIAL ABILITY SCORES</h2>

<h3>WOUNDS (WND)</h3>
<p>
Wounds represents a character's body's current health and general damage. Characters with high
wounds can sustain cuts, bruises or other injuries and still keep living. High wound
characters also take more damage before falling unconcious.
</p>

<h3>CONSTITUTION (CON)</h3>
<p>
Constitution represents a character's overall physical durability. Characters with high
constitution are able to take more hits before their body registers it as damage, 
continue fighting or running for longer, holding one's breath
or even fall further distances before being crippled.
</p>

<h3>VITALITY (VIT)</h3>
<p>
Vitality represents a character's overall internal resistance. Characters with high
vitality tend to outlive poisons, venoms and diseases more easily.
</p>

<h2>PHYSICAL ABILITY SCORES</h2>

<h3>STRENGTH (STR)</h3>
<p>
Strength represents a character's muscle quantity and raw physical power.
Characters with high strength can carry more objects as well as strike harder.
Strength increases the chance of breaking through armour with physical attacks
and the effectiveness of skills that have to do with muscled exertations
such as climbing or swimming.
</p>

<h3>AGILITY (AGI)</h3>
<p>
Agility represents a character's nimbleness, speed and grace of movement.
Characters with high agility can move faster and with more ease than most while
also having an easier time crossing over acrobatic obstacles. Agility increases
actions per round, ease of movement, striking speed, turn initiative and skills
that have any acrobatic components.
</p>



    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>DEXTERITY (DEX)</h3>
<p>
Dexterity represents a character's attention to small movements and finess.
Characters with high dexterity have an easier time with detailed actions such
as picking locks and pockets or crafting a detailed object. Dexterity is used
to increase many skill that provide characters alternatives instead of face to
face combat, however is also used to calculate the character's aim to strike
opponents with ranged weaponry.
</p>

<h2> MIND ABILITY SCORES</h2>

<h3>INSTINCT (INS)</h3>
<p>
Instinct represents a character's overall ability to sense dangers and react to
them. Characters with great instincts tend to find themselves in fewer dangerous
situations than others, reacting to situations almost before they happen.
Instinct directly impacts a creature's initiative in combat, their ability to
intuitively dodge attacks and increases any skill which requires sensing their opponent's
actions.
</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE (INT)</h3>
<p>
Intelligence represents a character's book knowledge and memory retention.
Characters with high intelligence are usually well read and well versed in the
mysteries of the world. Intelligence is most notably used for scholar characters
as it determines the number of languages known and their well of knowledge upon
chosen subjects.
</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER (WIL)</h3>
<p>
Willpower represents a character's overall ability to resist outer influences.
Characters with high willpower are not as easily persuaded nor scared and are
better able to resist magical domination and illusion effects.

<h2>SOCIAL ABILITY SCORES</h2>

<h3>WISDOM (WIS)</h3>
<p>
Wisdom represents a character's action knowledge and ability to read people.
Characters with high wisdom will usually know what to do and how to react in
most situations. Wisdom therefore increases many skills in which being alert
and mindful is the most appropriate action to survive.
</p>

<h3>CHARISMA (CHA)</h3>
<p>
Charisma represents a character's overall ability to speak, persuade and
influence a target through speech. Characters with high charisma seem to know
exactly which words will make things go their way. Charisma is very useful for
characters who wish to resolve situations through speech and reasoning

in which kneels my faith.” - Pendar, Paladin of Arenya
</p>


    </div><div class="bookpage-column">


<h3>ELEGANCE (ELE)</h3>
<p>
Elegance represents a character's physical attractiveness, beauty and the visual grace
of their movements. Characters with a high elegance score have an easier time 
influencing and seducing others. However, beauty without
wit or charm only gets a character so far and it is the least effective method of
influencing a target over time.
</p>


<h2>Reading Ability Scores</h2>

<p>
The abbreviations of the ability scores are used on the species page, with a number
below it. 
<br><b>SCORE : </b> :The number is the value of the ability score, and is what is used for any
calculations of attributes or for dice rolls when needing a score check.
<br><b>++ : </b> The ++ below is how much the score can increase with training or through natural
talent. A creature cannot exceed this total score, unless with magical aid or through
very specific rules. Wounds is the only score that hasn't an upper limit, for it cannot
be increased normally.
</p>
<h4>EXAMPLE : Human (Male - Karthian)</h4>
<table style="text-align:center;">
<tr><td></td><th> Wnd </th><th> Con </th><th> Vit </th><th> Str </th><th> Agi </th><th> Dex </th></tr>
<tr><th>SCORE</th><td> 12 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 5 </td><td>  10  </td><td>  10  </td><td>  10  </td></tr>
<tr><th>++</th><td> - </td><td> +2 </td><td> +2 </td><td>  +3  </td><td>  +3  </td><td>  +3  </td></tr>
<tr><td></td><th> Ins </th><th> Int </th><th> Will </th><th> Wis </th><th> Cha </th><th> Ele </th></tr>
<tr><th>SCORE</th><td> 7 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 8 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 9 </td></tr>
<tr><th>++</th><td> +2 </td><td> +6 </td><td> +4 </td><td> +3 </td><td> +4 </td><td> +3 </td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Increasing Ability Scores</h3>
<p>
Ability scores may be increased by players when creating their characters, trying
to match their backstory as best as possible. The ability scores given at base
is the average of a species. 
<br><b><i> Note that ability score increases are a rare occurance, and requires
intense training in said area, or an incredible talent. Be wary to not create too strong a 
character.</b></i>
There are some stronger classes, such as wizards or knights
which show on their class page ability score increases. These aren't necessary,
but are the average ability scores of any character following that path.
</p>
<!-- by
choosing any number of their species' available classes and spending their mastery. 
If a player chooses multiple classes with the same ablility
score increase, they choose the greater one and don't add the benefits together.

<p>
Should a player wish to gain the benefits of a class' talents, although don't want the
ability score increase that comes along with that choice due to their backstory
or characters lore, they may ignore the ability score increase.
</p>
-->
<h3>Decreasing Ability Scores</h3>
<p>
If a character's backstory should dictate their ability scores be lowered, this
is entirely up to the player's choice. While it isn't recommened,
there is nothing stopping the player from creating a weaker
variation of thier chosen species.
</p>
<p>
<b>Player Tip!:</b> Ultimately when choosing the character's ability scores it is
best to keep to try and match the backstory of the
created character. It is even possible to play as a simple villager adventuring
for their first time by not choosing any class nor talents. As with all things,
keep in mind the other players and their playstyles as well!

<h3>Ability Score Tiers</h3>

bonuses.

<h3>Ability Score Averages</h3>
<p>
Every species (as shown in the examples) within the beastiary is assinged an
ability score in all three categories. The number shown represents the normal,
average habitant or traveller of said species. Yet there are certain individuals
within the masses are gifted, trained, or simply better or worse at parts of
their abilities. This is represented by the increase or decrease of ability
scores.

creatures.)</p>
