<h1>Ability Scores</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
Ability scores are the core representation of every creature's general aptitudes,
each notes by a flat number which in turn denotes a tier. These numbers determine
the creature's. statistics for various facets such as their might, swiftness,
bravery, balance and so on.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Human (Male - Karthian) - Medium Humanoid</h4>
<table>
<tr><th> Str </th><th> Con </th><th> Agi </th><th> Dex </th><th> Ins </th><th> Int </th><th> Will </th><th> Wis </th><th> Cha </th><th> Bea </th><tr>
<tr><td>  7  </td><td>  7  </td><td>  6  </td><td>  7  </td><td>  6  </td><td>  7  </td><td>  6   </td><td>  6  </td><td>  7  </td><td>  6  </td><tr>
</table>

<h4>House Cat (Female- Tabby) - Tiny Beast</h4>
<table>
<tr><th> Str </th><th> Con </th><th> Agi </th><th> Dex </th><th> Ins </th><th> Int </th><th> Will </th><th> Wis </th><th> Cha </th><th> Bea </th><tr>
<tr><td>  2  </td><td>  2  </td><td>  8  </td><td>  3  </td><td>  9  </td><td>  2  </td><td>  4   </td><td>  4  </td><td>  2  </td><td>  7  </td><tr>
</table>

<h4>Gryphon (Male - Brown) - Large Beast</h4>
<table>
<tr><th> Str </th><th> Con </th><th> Agi </th><th> Dex </th><th> Ins </th><th> Int </th><th> Will </th><th> Wis </th><th> Cha </th><th> Bea </th><tr>
<tr><td> 13  </td><td> 14  </td><td> 12  </td><td>  3  </td><td> 12  </td><td>  2  </td><td> 10   </td><td>  4  </td><td>  2  </td><td>  9  </td><tr>
</table>

<h3>Ability Score Categories</h3>
<p>
Abilities are split into distinct categories. These are the Physical, Mind and
Social abilities, each governing a part of the character's whole. The details
for each is detailed on the further pages.
</p>

<table>
<tr><td> Physical    </td><td> Strenth, Constitution, Agility, Dexterity   </td></tr>
<tr><td> Mind        </td><td> Instinct, Intelligence, Willpower           </td></tr>
<tr><td> Social      </td><td> Wisdom, Charisma, Beauty                    </td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Ability Score Tiers</h3>
<p>
Ability score tiers are an approximation of the ablity score's power against
the average of the realm's. Each ability tier increase or decrease represents a
significant difference in the power of the ability score and grants additional
bonuses.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th> Tier          </th><th> Ability Score </th><th> Bonus   </th></tr>
<tr><td> Minor         </td><td>    1-2        </td><td>  -2     </td></tr>
<tr><td> Lessor        </td><td>    3-5        </td><td>  -1     </td></tr>
<tr><td> Standard      </td><td>    6-10       </td><td>   0     </td></tr>
<tr><td> Greater       </td><td>    11-15      </td><td>  +1     </td></tr>
<tr><td> Superior      </td><td>    16-20      </td><td>  +2     </td></tr>
<tr><td> Mighty        </td><td>    21-30      </td><td>  +3     </td></tr>
<tr><td> Legendary     </td><td>    31-40      </td><td>  +4     </td></tr>
<tr><td> Mythical      </td><td>     41+       </td><td>  +5     </td></tr>
</table>

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>Ability Score Averages</h3>
<p>
Every species (as shown in the examples) within the beastiary is assinged an
ability score in all three categories. The number shown represents the normal,
average habitant or travellor of said species. However certain individuals
within the masses are gifted, trained, or simply better or worse at parts of
their abilities. This is represented by the increase or decrease of ability
scores.
</p>

<table>
<tr><td> 1  </td><td> Pixie         </td><td> 2  </td><td> House Cat     </td></tr>
<tr><td> 4  </td><td> Halfling      </td><td> 5  </td><td> Goblin        </td></tr>
<tr><td> 7  </td><td> Human         </td><td> 9  </td><td> Panther       </td></tr>
<tr><td> 10 </td><td> Grizzly       </td><td> 12 </td><td> Minotaur      </td></tr>
<tr><td> 14 </td><td> Ogre1         </td><td> 17 </td><td> Roc           </td></tr>
<tr><td> 18 </td><td> Hill Giant    </td><td> 29 </td><td> Treant        </td></tr>
<tr><td> 25 </td><td> Hydra         </td><td> 32 </td><td> Dune Wurm     </td></tr>
<tr><td> 33 </td><td> Xia Serpent   </td><td> 35 </td><td> Pit Fiend     </td></tr>
<tr><td> 37 </td><td> Dragon        </td><td> 42 </td><td> Colossus      </td></tr>
<tr><td> 46 </td><td> Kraken        </td><td> 50 </td><td> Elder Dragon  </td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Increasing Ability Scores</h3>
<p>
Ability scores may be increased by players when creating their characters by
choosing any number of their species' available classes. The increase is specified
on the class itself. If a player chooses multiple classes with the same ablility
score increase, they choose the greater one and don't add the benefits together.
<strong>Keep in mind, each point in an ability score is a significant difference
of power!</strong>
</p>

<p>
Should a player wish to gain the benefits of a class, although don't want the
ability score increase that comes along with that choice due to their backstory
or characters lore, they may ignore the ability score increase.
</p>

<h3>Decreasing Ability Scores</h3>
<p>
If a character's backstory should dictate their ability scores be lowered, this
is entirely up to the player's choice. While it isn't recommened due to how class
feats function, there is nothing stopping the player from creating a weaker
variation of thier chosen species.
</p>

<p>
<b>Player Tip!:</b> Ultimately when choosing the character's ability scores it is
best to keep to the rulebook's numbers and to try and match the backstory of the
created character. It is even possible to play as a simple villager adventuring
for thier first time by not choosing any class and not increasing no decreasing
any ability scores. As with all things, keep in mind the other players and their
playstyles as well!

Strength represents a character's muscle quantity and raw physical power.
Characters with high strength can carry more objects as well as strike harder.

increasing the effectiveness of skills that have to do with muscled exertations
such as climbing or swimming.
</p>

<h3>CONSTITUTION (CON)</h3>
<p>
Constitution represents a character's vitality and health. Characters with high
constitution tend to outlive dangerous situations while also overcoming poisons
and diseases more easily. Constitution increases a character's health, their
resistance to toxins and poisons as well as certain physical actions such as
keeping one's breath.
</p>

<h3>AGILITY (AGI)</h3>
<p>
Agility represents a character's nimbleness, speed and grace of movement.
Characters with high agility can move faster and with more ease than most while
also having an easier time crossing over acrobatic obstacles. Agility increases
actions per round, ease of movement, greater striking, turn initiative and skills
that have any acrobatic components.
</p>

<h3>DEXTERITY (DEX)</h3>
<p>
Dexterity represents a character's attention to small movements and finess.
Characters with high dexterity have an easier tim with detailed movements such
as picking locks and pockets or crafting a detailed object. Dexterity is used
to increase many skill that provide characters alternatives instead of face to
face combat, however is also used to calculate the character's aim to strike
opponents with ranged weaponry
</p>

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h2> MIND ABILITY SCORES</h2>

<h3>INSTINCT (INS)</h3>
<p>
Instinct represents a character's overall ability to sense dangers and react to
them. Characters with high instinct tend to find themselves in fewer dangerous
situations than others, reacting to situations almost before they happen.
Instinct directly impacts a creature's initiative in combat, their ability to
intuitively dodge attacks and increases any skill which requires sensing their opponent.
</p>

<h3>INTELLIGENCE (INT)</h3>
<p>
Intelligence represents a character's book knowledge and memory retention.
Characters with high intelligence are usually well read and well versed in the
mysteries of the world. Intelligence is most notably used for scholar characters
as it determines the number of languages known and their well of knowledge upon
chosen subjects.
</p>

<h3>WILLPOWER (WILL)</h3>
<p>
Willpower represents a character's overall ability to resist outer influencesl
Characters with high willpower are not as easily persuaded nor scared and are
better able to resist magical domination and illusion effects. Unlike all other
ability scores, willpower is never used for rolls and is instead the difficulty
check for other skills and effects.

<h2>SOCIAL ABILITY SCORES</h2>

<h3>WISDOM (WIS)</h3>
<p>
Wisdom represents a character's action knowledge and ability to read people.
Characters with high wisdom will usually know what to do and how to react in
most situations. Wisdom therefore increases many skills in which being alert
and mindful is the most appropriate action to survive.
</p>

<h3>CHARISMA (CHA)</h3>
<p>
Charisma represents a character's overall ability to speak, persuade and
influence a target through speech. Characters with high charisma seem to know
exactly which words will make things go their way. Charisma is very useful for
characters who wish to resolve situations through speech and reasoning
</p>

<h3>BEAUTY (BEA)</h3>
<p>
Beauty represents a character's physical attractiveness and elegance.
Characters with a high beauty score have an easier time being accepted by most
races and will find themselves in less trouble overall. However, beauty without
wit or charm only gets a character so far and is the least effective method of
influencing a target over time.
