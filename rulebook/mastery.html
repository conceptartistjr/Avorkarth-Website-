<h1>MASTERY</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
Avorkarth is a more settled world, where the mighty and magical are rare and the
skilled are just that, skilled, nothing more. Mastery represents the character's
ability in certain skills compared to the rest of its own species
through determination and practice.
</p>

<p>
Although mastery may not give a weak character the ability to level mountains,
a character with mastered skill has a much higher chance of success in their field
of expertise.
</p>

<h3>MASTERY CATEOGRIES</h3>

<p>
<b>Natural Skills</b> : Natural skills are the everyday abilities of creatures and as
such don't require any knowledge to use. However, they are the hardest to master as they 
require a creature to surpass their natural ability.
</p>

<p>
<b>Trained Skills</b> : Trained Skills, which include Learned, Knowledge, Weapon and Trade
mastery, while having a harsher penalty to begin with, have a greater potential of
benefit given time and effort on the part of the character.
</p>

“True dedication to one's craft leads to creations beyond the imagined.” - Enchanter Luzark
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
<b>Weapon Mastery</b> : While each weapon has its own mastery, proficiency in similar 
weaponry is given at the same skill bonus but -1. (So a short sword and a
long sword would be different masteries, but share the weapon type of "One-Handed Sword".)
Likewise, this mastery extends to all weaponry but at a -3. (Such as a sword compared to a
spear or a bow.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Trade Mastery</b> : Trade Skills, much like Weapon mastery, is on a per
trade basis, but certain trades overlap or give bonuses elsewhere, such as a dancer
having a natural sense of balance and grace. These are shown in the skill section.
</p>

<h3>MASTERY PER YEARS</h3>
<p><b>Tutelage</b> : Trained Skill Mastery ranks often have sub-ranks which require
the character to do that rank twice before moving to the next.</p>

<h1>CLASS TALENTS</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>CLASSES | TALENTS</h3>
<p>
Unlike many table-top games, a player is not locked in a class of a specific
choice in the realm of Avorkarth. Instead, the player may pick and choose from
the list of talents available to their race to create their own class,
matching as closely as possible to their backstory. Want a thief who is good at
sword fighting? No problem, that can be done. What about a shamanistic barbarian?
Take talents from the Fighter, Adept and Bard classes, and you've a fearsome
warrior caster.
<strong>Keep in mind however that Avorkarth is a low powered world
where the mystical and wondrous are exactly that. Even a single talent from any
category puts a character way ahead of the average of their kind.</strong>
While a player could technically mix and match 30+ class talents to create a
really powerful character, to be as such would require quite the fairy tale of
a backstory. 
</p>

<h3>CLASS CATEGORIES/RANKS</h3>
<p>
While many of the classes can be used by any character, there are more
specialized classes that are evolutions or progressions of earlier classes.
An example of this would be the Karthian knight or assassin. These are classes
that become available once a certain number of talents were chosen prior and
need certain requirements met. Classes range from Rank 1 to Rank 6 in terms
of power and complexity.
</p>
<h3>CLASS REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>
Sometimes a class will have one or more requirements to be met before any of the
talents can be taken. Most often, this would be a certain level of mastery in one
of its subjects, or a certain amount of talents from other classes. For example,
a character needs 2 rogue talents and 2 fighter talents before they can take any
assassin talents.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>CLASS BONUS</h3>
<p>
Whenever a character chooses a class (even before choosing any of the feats), 
the character may automatically gains a bonus for reaching the level of 
expertise needed. This class bonus is always part of the character and must
be applied. Not all classes have this, but it'll be at the top of the feat listings.
</p>

<h3>RACIAL/SPECIES CLASSES</h3>
<p>
Some classes or variant feats are locked to a certain species or race within that species.
This is due to certain gods granting
powers or ways of the past anchoring their methods or physiological specialties. 
This makes it so that each
area has their own specialities, such as the karthian's priests of Eonna compared
to the sharassian's priests of Orsir.
</p>

<h3>CLASS RARITY</h3>
<p>
Adventurers and like specialist are rare in the lands of avorkarth. Even the
most common of classes, such as the warrior or scholar are paths taken by very few .
The class rarities are as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Adventurer Class - 1 per 2,500</li>
<li>Specialized Class - 1 per 25,000</li>
<li>Mighty Class -  1 per 250,000</li>
<li>Fabled Class - 1 per 2,500,000</li>
<li>Legendary Class - 1 per 25,000,000</li>
<li>Mythical Class - Only a few per Age</li>
</ul>

<h1>CLASSES</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
	<div class="bookpage-column">


<h3>CLASSES PER RARITY</h3>
<p>
As stated above, those who focus their years dedicated to a way of life and with 
a natural ability can develop a talent 
within. This focus is often shown by a path tread throughout the character's life, known as a class.
While characters are not limited to a single class, most living in Avorkarth 
do not even have a single talent.
</p>

<h3>ADVENTURER CLASSES <br><i>(1 individual per population of 2,500)</i> </h3>
<p>Those with enough time and effort given to a single path are known as adventurers. These
individuals rise above the common clout and are often requested for dangerous missions or
delicate situations. Many adventurers become well known in their locale for their prowess.</p>
