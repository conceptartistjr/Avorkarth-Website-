<h1>COMBAT ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">
<p>
While the everyday civilized creature does not have to worry about it, the realm
of Avorkarth is one of danger lurking ‘round every corner. As such, adventurers,
heroes, villains and creatures of all kinds must fight to simply live and reap
the rewards of each further day. The combat attributes use the base ability
scores to tell how efficient the creature is at these moments of conflict.
</p>

<h2>COMBAT ATTRIBUTES</h2>

<h3>WOUNDS</h3>
<p>
Wounds is the total amount of lethal damage a character can take before dying
or falling unconscious. This is due to there being two different methods of
wounding a character, one being lethal and the other being non-lethal. Wounds
are separated into three categories : Wounds, Lesser Wounds and Minor Wounds.
</p>

<p><b> Wounds </b> : 1 to 1 ratio with the character's wound statistic. Should the character
receive this many wounds, they perish.

<p class="centered">
WOUNDS <br> Wounds
</p>

<br><b> Lesser Wounds </b> : 5 to 1 ratio (1 wound = 5 lesser wounds). When a character takes
5 lesser wounds, they convert them into a full wound.
<br><b> Minor Wounds </b> : 10 to 1 ratio (1 lesser wound = 10 minor wounds). When a character takes
10 minor wounds, they convert them into a lesser wound.
</p>

<p><b> Non-Lethal Wounds </b> : Whenever a creature takes a wound (in any category), they also
take an equivalent non-lethal wound. However, if a creature does not wish their opponent dead and
simply knock them out, there are ways of dealing non-lethal damage instead.

<p class="centered">
NON-LETHAL WOUNDS <br> Wounds - 1
</p>

<p>
<b>Unconsciousness</b> : If a character receives non-lethal damage equal to their
total non-lethal wounds, they fall unconscious. In such a state the character cannot move,
take any actions or defend themselves.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bleeding out</b> : A truly dangerous state to be in, if a creature is attacked while 
unconscious, they gain the
bleeding out state and take 1 lesser wound every round thereafter until it is
healed with the heal skill or by a magical spell.
</p>

<h3>REGAINING WOUNDS</h3>

<p>
Wounds return at different rates depending on the amount of damage needing repairs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wounds </b> : Wounds are not removed during a campaign, unless healed by magical or
divine means.
</p>
<p><b> Lesser/Minor Wounds </b> :  Minor wounds are removed at a pace of 1 per week of in-game
time, with lesser wounds being removed whenever all minor wounds are removed. This next lesser wound
is then converted into ten minor wounds, beginning the healing procedure again.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>WOUNDED STATES (OPTIONAL) </h3>
</p>
<p>
If a creature receives a certain amount of lethal wounds,
they are ever more crippled. These are known as Wounded States and carry
increasing penalties.</p>
<table> 
<tr><th class="w20"> State</th><th class="w20"> Wounds</th><th class="w60">  Effect                        </th></tr>
<tr><td> Well      </td><td> Full    </td><td> None                                                        </td></tr>
<tr><td> Hurt      </td><td> 3/4     </td><td> -1 Movement, Dodge and Attack                               </td></tr>
<tr><td> Wounded   </td><td> 1/2     </td><td> Half Movement and Dodge, -2 Attack, -1 Might. Bleeding Out. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Crippled  </td><td> 1/10    </td><td> 1 Movement and Dodge, halve all other combat attributes.    </td></tr>
</table>

<h3>INITIATIVE</h3>
<p>
Initiative determines how quickly the character reacts to combat and how swiftly
they enact their actions. It is used in combat to determine who goes first,
second and so on.
</p>

<p class="centered">
INITIATIVE <br>  Instinct
</p>

<h3>SWIFTNESS</h3>
<p>
Swiftness is how many actions a creature can do within a round regardless of their Initiative, showing
how quickly a creature moves in a small amount of time.
</p>

<p class="centered">
SWIFTNESS <br>  Agility
</p>

<h3>ATTACK</h3>
<p>
The attack attribtue is used in combat to determine the effectiveness of a
character's ability with weaponry, be it sword, bow, fist, claw or maw.
However, the scores used for the values can be different, one being dextrous
precision, the other being agile speed.
</p>

<p class="centered">
MELEE ATTACK <br> (Agility OR Dexterity + Instinct)/2 (rounded down)
</p>

<p class="centered">
RANGED ATTACK <br> (Dexterity + Instinct)/2 (rounded down) - 4
</p>

<h3>MIGHT</h3>
<p>
Any attack which hits the desired target must also bypass their natural or worn
armour. Might is the value used for this and is also heavily impacted by the
character's weapon.
</p>

<p class="centered">
MIGHT <br> Strength OR Weapon Might
</p>
<!--
<h3>DAMAGE</h3>
<p>
Should a strike go through the opponent's armour, it then deals damage.
This damage is slightly modified by the character's strength, but mostly relies
on the weapon itself.
</p>

<p class="centered">
DAMAGE <br> Strength/3 (rounded down)

<div class="bookpage">

<h1>COMBAT ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>DODGE</h3>
<p>
Dodging is the primary method of defense, showing the character's ability to
weave through combat and evade blows, arrows or directed spells.
</p>

<p class="centered">
DODGE <br> (Agility + Instinct)/2 (rounded down) + Armour Penalty
</p>

<p>
<b>Directional Dodge</b> : While in combat, the character's facing matters just
as much as their placing. Almost each creature in Avorkarth has a front,
flank and back. This can affect dodge rather harshly.
</p>

<p>
DIRECTIONAL DODGE
</p>

<p>
Front : Retain the full dodge amount.
</p>

<p>
Flank : Flank attacks increase the attack's rolling category by 1.
</p>

<p>
Back : Back attacks increase the attack's rolling category by 3.
</p>

<h3>PARRYING</h3>
<p>
An alternative to dodging, some heavily armoured warriors, or those with
belief in their skill at arms may instead parry. The attacker's attack always hits
when parrying, but never at a critical. Parrying is influenced by one's
arm strength as well as one's proficiency with their current weapon.
Parrying isn't a roll and is instead added on top of one's armour amount before
any calculation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Blocking</b> : If a character has a shield, they instead block the attack,
also adding the shield's block value to the parry.
</p>

<p class="centered">
PARRY <br> Strength/3 (rounded down) + Dexterity/4 (rounded down)
</p>

<h3>ARMOUR</h3>
<p>
Armour is the tertiary and final method of defense, from armoured plating to
thick hides, it is used for any attack that isn't dodged or parried.
It is used to counter the attacker's strike and to possibly negate incoming damage.
</p>

<p>
<b>Armour Penalty</b> : Armour within the world will protect one's skin, at the cost
of hindering movement. Some armours come with an Armour Penalty, which is applied
to some skills and to the character's dodge. This is covered on a per skill basis.
</p>

<h3>ARMOUR TYPES</h3>
<p>
<b>Full Armour</b> : Worn armour is made to defend a creature in battle from all
incoming blows. Full armour bonuses apply to any attack which is made to the
character, as long as they are aware that they are in combat.
</p>

<p>
<b>Guarded Armour</b> : Most armours and shields better protect against attacks
made to the front or flank, but less so against attacks from the back.
Guarded armour bonuses are only applied to frontal and flank attacks.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
<b>Natural Armour</b> : All creatures have a skin to protect from minor injures.
These are natural to the creature and as such cannot be countered by positioning
unless specifically stated.
</p>

<h3>STAMINA</h3>
<p>
Stamina represents how quickly a character is exhausted in combat. When their stamina
is depleted, all combat attributes are reduced by 1, with a further 1 when they
reach -Stamina and then -Stamina x 2. (Normal, Tired, Fatigued and Exhausted.)
</p>
<p class="centered">
STAMINA <br> Constitution
</p>

<h3>RESISTANCES</h3>
<p>
Resistances offer a flat damage reduction to any damage of its type.
The resistances are as follows : Physical, Acid, Poison, Necrotic, Fire,
Cold, Shock, Holy, Infernal, Shadow and Spirit. Poison and Necrotic are
influenced by the character's vitality.
</p>

<p>
<b>Negative Resistances</b> : Should a creature have a negative score in their
resistances, they take reduced healing or increased damage equal to the
negative of the resistance.
</p>

<p class="centered">
POISON/NECROTIC RESISTANCE <br> Vitality
</p>

<h3>RESOLVE</h3>
<p>
Resolve is a character's ability to remain calm and collected no matter the circumstance
and is used primarily for Morale checks at the end of rounds.

<p class="centered">
RESOLVE <br> Will
</p>

<h3>PRESENCE</h3>
<p>
A character's presence upon the battlefield is ever important, not only to
leaders who wish to bolster their allies, but also to strike fear into the enemy.
The creature's presence is used as the basis for resolve rolls during combat.
</p>
<p>
<b>Terrifying Size</b> : A creature of Large size gains a +1 bonus to their presence,
doubling per size greater than Large.
</p>
<p>
<b>Defend the fair</b> : Presence using Elegance only affects allies, and another
ability score must be used to cause fear to enemies.
</p>

<p class="centered">
PRESENCE <br>  Constitution OR Strength OR Charisma OR Elegance
<br>+ 1 per 5 Wounds - 5

<p>
From the clash of steel upon the battlefield, to duels within a gladitorial arena,
to a heroic group of warriors battling a drake upon a snowed mountain, combat within
Avorkarth may happen wherever the adventurer goes. Combat is replicated in
avorkarth using a turn based system and begins when the Game Master declares so,
usually upon the request of a player or an ambush from deadly creatures.

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h4>TURNS VS. ROUNDS</h4>
<p>
Many effects happen either every so many turns or every so many rounds.
These are used to distinguish between different time signatures as combat occurs.

<p>
<b>Turn</b> : This is when a character does their actions, and is approximation of
a character's ability to do anything within a short amount of time.

<p>
<b>Round</b> : This is only updated once every character has acted all of their
turns. The round is an approximation of 6 seconds in real-time and is the most
common time keeper for effects with most of them occuring at the end of every round.

<!-- (Now in the enacting combat section)
<h4>ADDITIONAL TURNS AND EXTRA ACTIONS</h4>
<p>
Creatures gain 1 turn per round for each 6 agility. 
Every additional action after the first is added
as another turn in the round at the initial initiative - 5.
</p>
 THIS IS NOW IN INTERACTIONS!!!!
<h4>COMBAT ACTIONS</h4>
<p>
As noted, creatures have only a certain amount of actions they may do on a turn.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Round Action</b> : The creature must focus and concentrate. They lose all
their turns for the round.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Action</b> : The creature forgoes their move and standard actions for the
turn to use a full action instead. If they only have a move action for the turn,
they cannot do a Full Action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Standard Action (1 per turn)</b> : The standard action, most commonly used to
attack. Can be forgone to gain an additional move action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Move Action (1 per turn)</b> : The creature moves, climbs, swims or flies.
Can be forgone to do a swift action or lesser attack action. (See combat attacks further on.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Swift Action (1 per 8 agility per round - minimum 1.)</b> : A short action. Can be used
alongside a move or standard action on one's turn.
</p>

<p>
<b>Immediate Action (1 per 10 agility per round - minimum 1.)</b>: A very short action.
Can be used in reaction to enemy or allied actions even if not one's turn.
</p>
-->

<h4>COMBAT ACTIONS</h4>

<h3>COMBAT MOVEMENT</h3>
<p>
Although characters may move regularily during combat, there are a few
additional rulings and movement options that are possible using the
character's actions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Charging</b> : A creature may choose to charge a target,
gaining +1 to their attack, instead of simply moving and attacking. This can
onlly be done if the creature has a clear line between themselves and their
target and is at least 3 tiles away.
</p>

<img src="../images/rulebook/rulebook-combat2-img1.png">
<p class="caption">
A charge cannot change direction.
</p>

<p>
<b>Changing Facing Direction</b> : A character may change their
facing direction by up to 1 tile degree each round whenever a foe attempts to attack
them in order to properly face their opponent.
</p>

<img src="../images/rulebook/rulebook-combat2-img2.png">
<p class="caption">
While the creature may change direction to face B, the creature
attacking from C is too far to face in one action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prone/Standing Up</b> : A very short action. Can be used in reaction to enemy
or allied actions even if not one's turn.
</p>

<p>
<h3>LOCKING</h3>
<p>
Whenever a character is within a tile's distance, they are considered locked and in melee combat.
As such, a character can only do two actions while as such. Attack back, or retreat.

<br><br><b> Retreating </b> : A creature may retreat out of melee range, but may only use movement 
actions for their turn.

<h3>DIFFICULT TERRAIN</h3>
<p>
Characters moving through difficult terrain are hindered and lose a certain
amount of their movement speed and dodge.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tame (Sand/Rocky Terrain/Undergrowth)</b> :-2 Movement (Min. 1), -1 Dodge
</p>

<p>
<b>Difficult Terrain (Brush, Marshlands, Ruin Rubble)</b> :
Half or -4 Movement (whichever is worse, Min 1), - 3 Dodge.
</p>

<p>
<b>Difficult Terrain (Quicksand)</b> : No Movement, -6 Dodge.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>ATTACKING/DEFENDING</h3>
<p>
Should a character wishes to harm another for any reason, be it with sword or bow,
the must declare an attack action. The rolls associated with attacking must be
rolled per attack, not one roll for all attacks.
</p>

<h4>ATTACKING</h4>
HIT -> STRIKE -> DAMAGE

<h4>HITTING</h4>
(ATTACK VS DODGE)
<p>
To see if an attack hits one's opponent, the attacking creature must roll against
their opponent's dodge unless the defender is blocking/parrying. 
Compare these values on the roll chart then roll to see
what the outcome would be. (See Dice Rolls chart)
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Success</b> : The attacker's striking value is one category higher.
If the attacker's strike is also a critical, then the attacker may roll an additional hit.
This can keep going until no other critical hits AND strikes are rolled.
</p>

<p>
<b>Success</b> : The attack hits, with no additional bonuses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Success</b> : The opponent was able to parry the blow. The attacker's striking
value is one category lower.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fail</b> : The opponent dodges the attack. The attack doesn't hit and can't
be rolled for Striking.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Fail</b> : MELEE : The opponent outmaneuvers the attacker and may use an
immediate action to make an attack of opportunity. (See further)
RANGED : Fumble and drop your weapon.

<h1>COMBAT</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>STRIKING</h3>

<h3>(MIGHT VS ARMOUR)</h3>
<p>
Each attack that hits an opponent doesn't automatically deal damage. They must
rolled a second time to see if said attack goes through the opponent's armour.
Compare each attack's might and the opponent's armour on the dice rolling chart,
then roll the strikes. If it goes through, the weapon's damage is applied to the
opponent's wounds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Success</b> : The defender takes a Wound. If the attack was a critical
hit AND a critical strike, roll another attack. This keeps going until either the attack
or strike rolled are not criticals.
</p>

<p>
<b>Success</b> : The weapon's Lesser Wound damage is applied.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Success</b> : The weapon's Minor Wound damage is applied.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fail</b> : The damage is negated.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Fail</b> : The damage is negated and the weapon takes a durability damage
point. If unarmed, the attacker instead takes 1 minor wound.
</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL STRIKING DAMAGE</h3>
<p>
The amount of damage dealt is directly indicated by the weapon used. However, the difference
in strength between the users also changes the damage dealt, with the advantage to the 
creature with a greater strength score. (It follows the dice rolling table)
<table> 
<tr><th class="w20"> STRENGTH DIFFERENCE</th><th class="w60">  Effect                        </th></tr>
<tr><td> +/- 0     </td><td> No Effect                                                        </td></tr>
<tr><td> +/- 1     </td><td> Add/Remove 5 minor wounds to the damage. (To a minimum of 1 minor wound).  </td></tr>
<tr><td> +/- 2   </td><td> Add/Remove 1 lesser wound to the damage. (To a minimum of 1 minor wound). </td></tr>
<tr><td> +/- 3  </td><td> Add/Remove 1 wound to the damage. (To a minimum of 1 minor wound). </td></tr>
<tr><td> +/- 5  </td><td> Add/Remove 3 wounds to the damage. (To a minimum of 1 minor wound).    </td></tr>
<tr><td> +/- 7  </td><td> Add/Remove 6 wound to the damage. (To a minimum of 1 minor wound).    </td></tr>
<tr><td> +/- 10  </td><td> Add/Remove 10 wounds to the damage. (Certain creatures cannot hurt others...)</td></tr>
</table>

<!-- I think I want the weapon size to simply be indicating damage dealt, so that damage dealt
can be equivalent when two creatures of the same size attack one another. 
<b>Weapon Size</b> : The attacker's damage is reduced by one category per enemy size greater 
(to a minimum of 1) and increased by one category
per size smaller, <b>doubling</b> this bonus per size difference. This is calculated
BEFORE strike critical and partial successes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Might/Armour Difference</b> : The weapon's damage is increased or 
decreased by 1 (to a minimum of 1) per rolling category when rolling to strike. 
(See Startup - Dice Rolling). This is calculated AFTER strike critical and partial
successes.

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>ATTACK/STRIKING ADDITIONAL RULES</h3>
<p>
Whenever a character attacks or is attacked, there are a few minor additional
rules that come into play and may be used to their advantage.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attacks of Opportuinty</b> : Whenever an attack of opportunity is given,
the creature may use an immediate action to do a single primary attack.
</p>

<p>
<b>Alternate Attacks</b> : Some creatures may have alternate primary attacks.
Which attack is used must be chosen before rolling to hit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Secondary Attacks</b> : Some creatures may have additional secondary attacks,
such as a bite, tail or claws. These can be added to the primary attacks by
using a swift action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dual Wielding</b> : For each additional weapon held by a creature, add another
primary attack but reduce all hitting values by 1.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesser Attack</b> :A creature may use it's given move action to instead do
a lesser attack. It acts as a primary attack with -1 to it's hitting values.
</p>

<p>
<b>Flanking</b> : For each additional ally within melee range of a creature,
reduce its dodge by 1. Positioning does not matter for flanking.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attack Positioning</b> : Positioning does matter for attacking however.
See Dodge. (Combat Attributes)
</p>


<h3>NON-LETHAL DAMAGE</h3>
<p>
Sometimes a creature may wish to simply knock out an opponent instead of killing them.
If this is the case, the attacker counts all their roll values with lethal weaponry
as one category lower on the dice roll chart. Non-lethal weaponry ignores this
rule and rolls normally.
</p>

<h3>COMBAT MANEUVERS</h3>
<p>
Combat maneuvers are attack actions that don't deal damage, instead attempting
to displace or control the target. Combat maneuvers only need to roll the
Hitting part of the attack actions and automatically pass Striking for their effects.
</p>

<p>
<b>Size</b> : Combat maneuvers are much harder to succefully do against any size
larger than oneself. For every size larger, the opponent gains a +4 bonus to
their dodge value, and it is impossible to do any combat maneuvers against
targets 3 sizes larger.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Fail</b> : MELEE : The weapon bounces off. Drop your weapon.
RANGED : The projectile breaks upon impact.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attack Penalties</b> : Combat maneuvers usually require slightly more skill
than simply attacking the target with a club. This is per maneuver.

<h2>COMBAT MANEUVERS</h2>

total movement. Must be in melee range and remain in melee range if dragging.
</p>

<p>
Cripple -1-X
Attempt to cripple a target within attacking range, reducing movement by half
for 1+X rounds.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Grapple -3
Attempt to partially grapple a target. (See Grappling)
</p>

<p>
Tackle +3
Attempt to fully grapple a target. (See Grappling) The target may use an
immediate action to get a free Striking roll with their primary attack.
</p>

<h3>GRAPPLING</h3>
<p>
Grappling can be initiated by two of the combat maneuvers, and unlike any other
combat maneuver results in a permanent state.
</p>

<p>
While grappled, the initiating creature and its opponent both lose partial to
full movement and lose bonuses to their Dodge. How much is depending on the
state of the grapple.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Grapple</b> : If a grapple check is successful, the target is grabbed
by the arm or leg. Both the grappler and target lose half their dodge.
The grappled target lowers their movement by half before any other movement calculations.
The two creatures drag each other whenever moving. If another grapple is successful,
the partial grapple becomes a full grapple.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Grapple</b> : If a grapple check is applied twice in a row or the target
was tackled, the grappled target may no longer move or use any limbs. The grappler
gains +5 to the Escaping Grapples check every round. If the grapple is succesful
once again, the grappler may choose to either pin or choke/constrict their target.
</p>

<p>
<b>Choke/Constrict</b> : The grappler deals i lethal damage every round, ignoring
all guarded armour bonuses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pin</b> : Pinning the target ends the grapple action and allows the grappler to
use rope or bindings to tie up the target. The target must now use their escape
artist checks against the bindings instead of strength checks against the grappler.
</p>

<p>
<b>Escaping Grapples</b> : Each round, the target and grappler must roll and add
their strength. If the target's total is greater than the grappler's, they escape.
</p>

<h3>CRITICAL WOUNDS (OPTIONAL)</h3>
<p>
If a Game Master is feeling kind, they may instead inflict critical wounds
whenever a player dies, instead leaving them with 1 lethal wound and unconscious
for the remainder of the current combat. Whenever this occurs, roll a die.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 - Eyes</b> : Blinded on one side. That side is now considered a creature's
“back” when attacked. -3 to all sight based skill checks. If it happens again,
all sides are considered the “back” and can no longer use sight.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 - Arms</b> : Limb is cut off. Halve all strength skill and grapple checks.
If no limbs remain, can no longer use strength skill checks.
</p>

<p>
<b>3 - Hips</b> : Hips and lower limbs are crippled. 
1 tile movement. Can't use move based
skills and actions
</p>

<p>
<b>4 - Hands</b> : Limb is cut off. Halve all dexterity based skill checks.
Can no longer use two-handed weapons. If no limbs remain, can't use dexterity
skills at all.
</p>

<p>

piece if available. (Wings, tails, spines... etc.). This critical wound can stack.
</p>

<p>
<b>6 - Head</b> : Reduce all rolls results by 1. This critical wound can stack.
</p>

<p>
Multi/Single Limbs: If a creature has more than 2 appendages, the GM may choose
how to apply the negatives at a reduced rate. If they have only a single limb
(like a tail for legs), automatically apply the full penalty.
</p>
