					<h2 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:0;"><u>Combat</u></h2>
					<p>From the clash of steel upon the battlefield to duels within a gladiatorial arena to a heroic warrior battling a drake upon a snowed mountain,
					combat within Avorkarth may happen wherever the adventurer goes. Yet all of these are replicated by following the Combat rules, no matter the
					encounter.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Initiating/Enacting Combat</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Combat begins when the Dungeon Master declares so, usually upon the request of a player or if the players are ambushed.</p>
					<p><u>A. IF AMBUSHED - (If not, go to B. - Mark Initiative)</u>
					<br>- All characters in the combat put their initiative bonus in a list, with the ambushing creatures adding +10 to their roll.
					<br>- Any ambushed creature whose initiative is higher than any of the ambushing creatures gets to act in the ambush round as well. 
					<br>- During the ambush round, creatures that can act only get a single turn, no matter their swiftness.
					<br> - The highest initiative goes first. On ties, players go first.
					<br> - Go to C. - Character Turn.
					
					<p><u>B. MARK INITIATIVE</u>
					<br> - Characters that participated in the ambush round keep their initial initiatives, simply removing the +10 bonus.
					<br> - If any character has a high enough swiftness for multiple turns, they take their initiative roll and decrease it
					accordingly for subsequent turns. <i>(See Actions - Swiftness)</i>
					<br> - All the initiatives in the list are re-organized, with the highest initiative going first, players win ties.
					<br> - The first character takes their turn : Go to C. - Character Turn.
					
					<p><u>C. CHARACTER TURN</u>
					<br> - The acting character gets their allocated number of standard actions on their turn and spends them however they wish.
					<br> - If an action, such as spellcasting, says that it takes one round (or more), the character must wait until their the next
					round before the action is capable to be enacted, even if they have additional upcoming turns. Unless specified, the character can 
					still use the next turn's actions for movement, but must otherwise remain focused on the longer action.
					<br> -- If all characters have taken their turns : Go to D. - Round End.	
					<br> -- If not : Repeat C. - Character Turn, for the next character in the initiative list.
			
					
					<p><u>D. ROUND END</u>
					<br> - Once all characters have taken their turns, a round of combat is over. Most effects, such as bleeding or spell timers are
					calculated per round. Update all these effects.
					<br> - Calculate the Resolve for the round for each side.
					<br> - After all effects are calculated, remove any character that perished from the round from the initiative list, and have the
					first character in the initiative list take their turn.
					<br> - If this is after the ambush round ends : Go to B. - Mark Initiative.
					<br> - If this is after a regular round ends : Go to C. - Character Turn.

				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Turns vs. Rounds</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Many effects happen either every so many turns or every so many rounds. These are used to distinguish between different time signatures
					that happen as combat occurs. Any effect that is beyon two turns only occurs once a round has passed (unless specified) (see Enacting
					combat).</p>
					<p><b> - Turn </b>: This is when a character does their actions, and is an approximation of a character's ability to do anything within a
					short amount of time.
					<br><b> - Round </b>: This is only updated once every character has acted and had their initiative reset at least once. 
					The round is an approximation of 60 seconds in real-time and is the most common time keeper for effects, with most of them occuring at the end
					of every round.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Attacking/Defending</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p> Should a character wish to harm another for any reason, be it with sword or bow, they must declare an attack action. All attack bonuses are 
					discussed in the Attributes section. This is simply the actions required to attacking. To wound another character the attacker must first hit them, then, 
					if that is successful, must pierce their armor.
					
					<p> A character gets attacks equal to their Primary attacks + their Secondary attacks on their first attack action. If they use their turn to 
					do two attack actions, then they may ONLY do their Primary attacks a second time.
					
					<p>To hit a target, the attacker must check their Attack Bonus relevant to the attack (Melee or Ranged) and compare it
					in the roll chart against the defender's Dodge attribute. If the dice's roll is equal to the required dice roll or higher, the attack
					hits and is carried over for the number of dice rolled for damage. </p>
					
					<p>To wound a target, the attacker rolls their attack's Wound Bonus, adds the relevant other bonuses and compares it against the defender's 
					armour attribute. Remember that the armour value sometimes changes depending on where or how the attacker is attacking. The amount of damage
					done to the opponent's Hit or Health points is calculated as how many points over the armour attribute the wound roll was. Wounds done by
					multiple hits or multiple attacks do not stack, and each instance of wounding damage to the armor or resistance attribute must be calculated
					seperately.
					
					<!--
					<p>In essence, the required dice is 4+ at or below 1 of the Attacker. If the Dodge value is any higher than the attacker's, then it is 
					increased by 1 per every 2. If the Dodge value is further below than 1 of the attacker, the 
					required dice is decreased per 1 for every additional 1.* <i><br>*(See ATTACK VS DODGE TABLE if confused!)</i></p> -->

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Lethal vs. Non-Lethal Intent</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Sometimes, the character may wish to simply knock-out an opponent instead of killing them. If this is the case, the attacker counts any 
					attacks with lethal weaponry as 1 roll category lower. This does not matter when attacking with 
					non-lethal weaponry such as fists or feet. Remember that Lethal damage deals equal damage to both
					health and hit points, and non-lethal only to hit points.</p>

					<p> To see if an attack connects against a foe, see the Table in the Actions section.</p>
					
					<p><b>Critical Fail (Overtaken)</b> :
					<br>A critical failed roll has it that the defender is able to outmaneuver the attack. The attacker is struck back by their
					defender. Roll a die. 
					<br>On a 10-8, nothing happens. 
					<br>On a 7-5 the attacker is pushed back 5 feet. 
					<br>On a 4-2 the attacker is also knocked prone and loses their weapon. 
					<br>On a 1, the defender gets a free primary attack as if the attacker was already prone.</p>
					<p><b>Fail (Dodged)</b> :
					<br>A failed roll means that the defender was able to fully dodge the attack. The attacker doesn't hit and doesn't roll wounding
					damage against the defender for that attack.</p>
					<p><b>Partial Success (Parried/Blocked)</b> :
					<br>A partial success means that the defender was able to parry or block the attack. The defender adds their parry and armour
					values against the wounding damage.</p>
					<p><b>Success (Hit)</b> :
					<br>A success means that the attacker struck successfully. The defender only adds their armour value against the 
					wounding damage.</p>					
					<p><b>Critical Success (Vital Hit)</b> :
					<br>A critical success means the attacker was able to strike a vital weak spot of the defender. The attacker gains 2 additional 
					damage and the defender only adds half their armour value against the wounding damage.</p>

					<!--
					<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Additional Combat Rules</h3>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Resolve (Will/Presence)</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>A character's Will upon the battlefield is ever important, giving them the courage to stand up against their foes. Unlike most other
					attributes, Will is easily swayed. Will is a fluctuating number, especially during combat. Weaker minds will often falter upon the sight
					of blood and guts, the screams of pain and the terror of the battlefield.
					
					<p><b>Resolve and Fear</b> : At the end of the round, each character counts how many allies within 20 squares took damage this turn. 
					Reduce it by the highest allied Presence score within 20 squares and add the highest enemy Presence ability score within 20 squares.
					<br>For each point higher the Resolve is than a character's Will score + 5, they gain a fear point.</p>
					
					<p><b>Regaining Will</b> : Unless a specific action or ability says otherwise, Fear is lowered at 1 point per day or when an ally 
					successfully uses the Inspire skill.-->
					
					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Movement Speed Bonus</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Agility's calculation for movement speed is changed by 5 feet per action for every Agility ability scores above or below average. 
					Keep in mind that each race has a base movement speed, which is then altered by Agility's bonuses or penalties.</p>
					
					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Number of Actions</h4></h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Truly agile characters may gain additional actions on their turn, their speed a blur to many others. Unlike movement speed, this is a 
					fixed number and is not modified from a base racial number, although it can still be increased or decreased by exterior influences like 
					talents or spells. These can be used for any action in combat, as long as another rule does not superced it, such as casting or 
					being grappling.</p>

					<i>**Agility beyond 15 keeps increasing at 1 action per agility</i>					
					-->
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Secondary Attacks</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Some characters may have alternate and additional attacks on top of their Primaries. Secondary attacks are usually those that are natural
					to the creature and may be added on top of any primary attacks, though only for the first attack action. As such, things like 
					tail sweeps or bite attacks or poison glands are secondary attacks. The secondary attacks of a creature are given on their Racial page and
					any item with a secondary attack will be given such rule upon the item itself. Count any non-descriptive attack as one of a Primary Attack.
					
					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Critical Hits</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Critical hits are the rare chance that the character hits a weak spot or lands a critical strike and happen when the damage dice
					roll a 6. When a critical hit occurs and deals damage, roll from the Critical Wounds table.</p>
					<!--Critical hits add an additional damage and, if the creature has a weak spot, 
					allows the character to enact that special rule. It is possible that even critical strikes don't deal any damage should the power level 
					between the characters be too much.	
					<br><b>Critical criticals</b> : Should a critical hit's damage roll a 6 and deals any damage to their Health Points
					, the target also takes a critical wound. (See Critical Wounds).</p>-->

					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Size Bonus/Penalty</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Damage done by <u>natural</u> weapons is also increased and decreased by the creature's size compared to its target. 
					If the creature is larger, Damage is increased by 1, doubling per additional size difference. So if a
					large creature attacks a small creature, they'd gain +2 to their total damage, or if they attack a tiny creature, they gain +4 to their total damage.
					If the creature is smaller, Damage is decreased by 1, increasing by an additional 1 per size difference. So if a tiny creature 
					attacks a medium creature, it'd lose 2 damage, while attacking a large creature it would lose 3.</p>
					-->

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Special Combat Rules</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">	
					<p><b>Charging</b> : A character may charge a target instead of simply moving and attacking. This uses the same amount of actions as moving and attacking,
					but gives the charging character +1 their Attack value. This can only be done if the character
					has a clear line between themselves and the target. Charges can only be done in a straight line and not over boulders or corpses.</p>
					<p><b>Lesser Attack</b> : A character may use their Move action to instead do a lesser attack. This attack is done at Attack Value
					-1.
					<p><b>Dual-Wielding</b> : A character may wield a weapon in their off hands, up to the amount of hands the character has. For each additional weapon
					held, the character gains an additional Primary attack but takes a -1 penalty to their Attack value.</p>
					<p><b>Flanking</b> : If two allied characters or more attack the same target, the foe takes a -1 penalty to their Dodge value. This is 
					increased by 1 per allied creature attacking the same target over the second. However! This only functions for creatures attacking targets
					of 1 size larger or smaller. This negative is added after the positioning negatives are calculated.</p>
					<p><b>Difficult Terrain</b> : Characters moving through difficult terrain are hindered and lose a certain amount of their movement speed 
					and dodge. 
					<br>Difficult terrains are split into three categories.
					<br>- Tame : -2 Movement (Minimum 1), -1 Dodge : Sand, Rocky Terrain, Undergrowth
					<br>- Harsh : Half Movement or - 4 Movement (Pick the worst, minimum 1), -3 Dodge : Brush, Marshlands, Ruin Rubble
					<br>- Severe : No Movement, -6 Dodge. : Quicksand 
					</p>
					<p><b>Attacks of Opportunity</b> : When a foe moves by a character that hasn't used their immediate actions for the turn 
					and the foe is within
					melee range, the character may do an Attack of Opportunity, doing a single Primary Attack or Combat Maneuver against the foe that ran past them.</p>
					<p><b>Prone</b> : Characters struck to the ground are immobile and are always attacked as if from the back. It takes a standard
					action to get back up, and offer up an Attack of Opportunity to any nearby foes.</p>
					<p><b>Changing Facing Direction</b> : The character may change their facing whenever a foe attempts to side-step them as an immediate
					action.</p>
					<p><b>Non-lethal Strike</b> : Characters may attack with non-lethal intent, though do so at the expense of fully commiting their strike. Any
					lethal weapon used with non-lethal intent reduces the attack value of the strike by 2. <i>(see earlier)</i></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Combat Maneuvers</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Combat maneuvers are attack actions that don't deal damage, instead attempting to displace or control the target. 
					Characters can only use a maneuver once per turn, but can use two <u>different</u> ones over the course of two actions. Should
					a combat maneuver hit, the attacker doesn't need to roll against the target's armor and the effect is automatically passed.</p>
					
					<p><b>Size Bonus</b>
					<br>Combat maneuvers are much harder to do to any size larger or smaller than oneself. For every size difference larger the defender gets +2 
					to their dodge value, and is impossible to do against any target 3 sizes larger. For every size smaller, the defender gets +1 to their dodge
					value.</p>
					<p><b>Attack Value Penalties</b>
					<br> Combat maneuvers require slightly more skill than simply attacking the target with a club. Difficulty checks lower the
					value of the attacker's attack value by the DC amount. This represents how difficult the maneuver is to pull off.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Grappling</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Grappling is another Combat Maneuver, but unlike the previous maneuvers, results in a permanent state. There are two ways
					to initiate grappling, which is to either grab the character or tackle them.</p>
					
					<p style="text-align:center;">COMBAT MANEUVERS - GRAPPLING</u>
					<table>
						<tr><th style="width:20%">Combat Maneuver</th><th style="width:10%">Attack Value</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
						<tr><td>Grapple</td><td>-3</td><td>The character uses an action to attempt to partially grapple the target. (See Gappling).</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Tackle</td><td>+3</td><td>The character uses an action to attempt to tackle and fully grapple the target. The target gets a
							free attack wound (primary only) on the grappler, ignoring their dodge.</td></tr>
					</table>
					<p>While grappled, the target and the character both lose partial to full movement and lose bonuses to their Dodge. How much is dependant
					on the state of the grapple. Each round, both the grappler and the grappled target must roll and add their Strength
					Score x 2 to determine if the grappled target escapes.</p>
					
					<p><b>Partial Grapple</b> : If the grapple check is successful, both the grappler and grappled target lose half their dodge and both
					targets may move at half speed, although always dragging the other with them. Each target may use a single action per turn.
					
					<p><b>Full Grapple</b> : If the grapple check is successful again or the target was tackled, the grappled target may no longer use 
					any action that requires limbs. The grappler now also gains +5 to their strength checks to keep the grapple. If the 
					grapple is still not broken by the grappler's next turn, the grappler may choose to either pin or choke/constrict their target.

					<p><b>Choke/Constrict</b> : The grappler's checks also deal 1/2/3/4 + grappler's strength lethal damage
					ignoring all guarded armor bonuses.
					
					<p><b>Pin</b> : Pinning the target ends the grapple action, and the grappler may use rope or bindings to tie up the grappled target.
					The target must now use their escape artist checks against the bindings intstead of strength checks against the grappler.

					<br><br>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Critical Wounds (Optional) - TO BE UPDATED (still using d6)</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Some wounds have lasting effects well beyond
					the time of action. Critical Wounds are rolled whenever a player is dealt half or more of their health points in a single strike.
					When this occurs, roll another d6 and see on the table below for the effect that happens.</p>
					<!--
					<p>Critical wounds are severe strikes, and unlike Hit Points that return over time, not all Wounds heal, especially if they are severe. 
					To see how the wound affects the character, they roll a 6 sided die and compare the result to the Wound table below. Wounds stack in intensity,
					so should a character takes a wound to an already wounded area, their injury is worsened.</p> -->
