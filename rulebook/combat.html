<h1>COMBAT ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">
<p>
While the everyday civilized creature does not have to worry about it, the realm
of Avorkarth is one of danger lurking ‘round every corner. As such, adventurers,
heroes, villains and creatures of all kinds must fight to simply live and reap
the rewards of each further day. The combat attributes use the base ability
scores to tell how efficient the creature is at these moments of conflict.
</p>

<h2>COMBAT ATTRIBUTES</h2>

<h3>WOUNDS</h3>
<p>
Wounds is the total amount of lethal damage a character can take before dying
or falling unconscious. This is due to there being two different methods of
wounding a character, one being lethal and the other being non-lethal.
</p>

<p>
WOUNDS Constitution
</p>

<p>
<b>Unconscious</b> : If a character receives non-lethal damage equal to their
total wounds, they fall unconscious. In such a state the character cannot move,
take any actions or defend themselves.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wounded</b> : If a creature receives a certain amount of lethal wounds,
they are ever more crippled. These are known as Wounded States and carry
increasing penalties.
</p>

<p>
WOUNDED STATES (wounds rounded down)
</p>

<table>
<tr><th> State     </th><th> Wounds  </th><th>  Effect                                                     </th></tr>
<tr><td> Well      </td><td> Full    </td><td> None                                                        </td></tr>
<tr><td> Hurt      </td><td> 3/4     </td><td> -1 Movement, Dodge and Attack                               </td></tr>
<tr><td> Wounded   </td><td> 1/2     </td><td> Half Movement and Dodge, -2 Attack, -1 Might. Bleeding Out. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Crippled  </td><td> 1/10    </td><td> 1 Movement and Dodge, halve all other combat attributes.    </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>Bleeding out</b> : A truly dangerous state to be in, if a creature gains the
bleeding out state, they lose 1 wound every round thereafter until it is
healed with the heal skill or by a magical spell.
</p>

<p>
<b>Regaining Non-Lethal Wounds</b> : Characters remove 1 non-lethal damage per day.
</p>

<p>
<b>Regaining Lethal Wounds (Heal Counters)</b> : It takes a long time for wounds
to heal. Creatures gain 1 heal counter per day. When a creature has 20 heal
counters, they lose all heal counters and regain 1 wound.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>INITIATIVE</h3>
<p>
Initiative determines how quickly the character reacts to combat and how swiftly
they enact their actions. It is used in combat to determine who goes first,
second and so on.
</p>

<p>
INITIATIVE Agility + (Instinct + Wisdom)/2 (rounded down)
</p>

<h3>ATTACK</h3>
<p>
The attack attribtue is used in combat to determine the effectiveness of a
character's ability with weaponry, be it sword, bow, fist, claw or maw.
However, the scores used for the values can be different, one being dextrous
precision, the other being agile speed.
</p>

<p>
MELEE ATTACK (Agility OR Dexterity + Instinct)/2 (rounded down)
</p>

<p>
RANGED ATTACK (Dexterity + Instinct)/2 (rounded down)
</p>

<h3>MIGHT</h3>
<p>
Any attack which hits the desired target must also bypass their natural or worn
armour. Might is the value used for this and is also heavily impacted by the
character's weapon.
</p>

<p>
MIGHT Strength
</p>

<h3>DAMAGE</h3>
<p>
Should a strike go through the opponent's armour, it then deals damage.
This damage is slightly modified by the character's strength, but mostly relies
on the weapon itself.
</p>

<p>
DAMAGE Strength/3 (rounded down)

<h1>COMBAT ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>DODGE</h3>
<p>
Dodging is the primary method of defense, showing the character's ability to
weave through combat and evade blows, arrows or directed spells.
</p>

<p>
DODGE (Agility + Instinct)/2 (rounded down) + Armour Penalty
</p>

<p>
<b>Directional Dodge</b> : While in combat, the character's facing matters just
as much as their placing. Almost each creature in Avorkarth has a front,
flank and back. This can affect dodge rather harshly.
</p>

<p>
DIRECTIONAL DODGE
</p>

<p>
Direction Effect
</p>

<p>
Front Retain the full dodge amount.
</p>

<p>
Flank Flank attacks increase the attack's rolling category by 1.
</p>

<p>
Back Back attacks increase the attack's rolling category by 3.
</p>

<h3>PARRYING</h3>
<p>
The secondary part of defense, should an attack partially hit,
is to deflect part of the incoming damage. Parrying is influenced by one's
arm strength as well as one's proficiency with their current weapon.
Parrying isn't a roll and is instead added on top of one's armour amount before
any calculation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Blocking</b> : If a character has a shield, they instead block the attack,
adding the shield's block value to the parry.
</p>

<p>
PARRY Strength/3 (rounded down) + Dexterity/4 (rounded down)
</p>

<h3>ARMOUR</h3>
<p>
Armour is the tertiary and final method of defense, from armoured plating to
thick hides, it is used for any attack that isn't dodged or parried.
It is used to counter the attacker's strike and to possibly negate incoming damage.
</p>

<p>
<b>Armour Penalty</b> : Armour within the world will protect one's skin, at the cost
of hindering movement. Some armours come with an Armour Penalty, which is applied
to some skills and to the character's dodge. This is covered on a per skill basis.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>ARMOUR TYPES
<p>
<b>Full Armour</b> : Worn armour is made to defend a creature in battle from all
incoming blows. Full armour bonuses apply to any attack which is made to the
character, as long as they are aware that they are in combat.
</p>

<p>
<b>Guarded Armour</b> : Most armours and shields better protect against attacks
made to the front or flank, but less so against attacks from the back.
Guarded armour bonuses are only applied to frontal and flank attacks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Natural Armour</b> : All creatures have a skin to protect from minor injures.
These are natural to the creature and as such cannot be countered by positioning
unless specifically stated.
</p>

<p>
NATURAL ARMOUR Constitution/3 (rounded down)
</p>

<h3>RESISTANCES</h3>
<p>
Resistances offer a flat damage reduction to any damage of its type.
The resistances are as follows : Physical, Acid, Poison, Necrotic, Fire,
Cold, Shock, Holy, Infernal, Shadow and Spirit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Negative Resistances</b> : Should a creature have a negative score in their
resistances, they take reduced healing or increased damage equal to the
negative of the resistance.
</p>

<h3>PRESENCE</h3>
<p>
A character's presence upon the battlefield is ever important, not only to
leaders who wish to bolster their allies, but also to strike fear into the enemy.
The creature's presence is used as the basis for resolve rolls during combat.
</p>

<p>
PRESENCE (Strength + Constitution + Will)/3 (rounded down)
</p>

<p>
<b>Terrifying Size</b> : A creature of Large size gains a +1 bonus to their presence,
doubling per size greater.
</p>

<p>
<b>Inspiring Beauty</b> : A creature may instead have use of their beauty to inspire
neaby allies. Note that this presence is only counted for allies, and enemies
must still use the highest strength based presence score.
</p>

<p>
ALTERNATE PRESENCE (Beauty + Will)/2 (rounded down)
</p>

<h1>COMBAT</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
From the clash of steel upon the battlefield, to duels within a gladitorial arena,
to a heroic warrior battling a drake upon a snowed mountain, combat within
Avorkarth may happen wherever the adventurer goes. Combat is replicated in
avorkarth using a turn based system and begins when the Game Master declares so,
usually upon the request of a player or an ambush from deadly creatures.
</p>

<h2>INITIATING/ENACTING COMBAT</h2>

<h4>COMBAT ORDER</h4>

<h4> A. - IF AMBUSHED</h4>
<p>
(If not, go to B.)
<ul>
<li> All creatures roll 1d6 and add their initiative, with ambushing creatures
     adding an additional +10 to their total.</li>
<li> Order all the initiatives in a list, from highest to lowest.</li>
<li> Any ambushed creature whose initiative is lower than the lowest ambushing
     creature does not act this round. - The highest initiative goes first.
     Players win ties. (Go to C.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> B. - MARK INITIATIVE</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> (If finishing an Ambush round) - Any ambushing creatures lose their
  +10 initiative bonus.</li>
<li> All creatures roll id6 and add their initiative</li>
<li> Any creature whose agility bonus is high enough adds their additional
     turns at their initiative - 5 per additional turn.</li>
<li> Order all the initiatives in a list, from highest to lowest.</li>
<li> The highest initiative goes first. Players win ties. (Go to C.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> C. - CREATURE'S TURN</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> If it is the creature's first turn in the round, they must roll their
     Resolve check.</li>
<li> The acting creature regains all standard, move, swift and immediate actions
     at the start of their first turn.</li>
<li> If a creature is doing a full round action and they have more than one turn,
     all turns are forgone and skipped unless they stop their full round action.</li>
<li> The creature may then use the equivalent of one move and one standard action,
     or one full action. (Unless specified otherwise).</li>
<li> The creature may choose to stay their actions and declare to use them another
     time, in which case their turn ends and they may re-enact their turn before
     any next creature's turn.</li>
<li> If all creatures have taken their turns - Go to D.</li>
<li> If not, repeat C. for the next creature in the initiative list.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> D. - ROUND'S END</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Enact all area, environmental and over-time effects, such as burns,
     bleeds or poisons.</li>
<li> Remove all creatures that have perished from the initiative list,
     and begin a new round with the updated initiative list.</li>
<li> The highest initiative goes first. Players win ties. (Go to C.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h4>TURNS VS. ROUNDS</h4>
<p>
Many effects happen either every so many turns or every so many rounds.
These are used to distinguish between different time signatures as combat occurs.

<p>
<b>Turn</b> : This is when a character does their actions, and is approximation of
a character's ability to do anything within a short amount of time.

<p>
<b>Round</b> : This is only updated once every character has acted all of their
turns. The round is an approximation of 8 seconds in real-time and is the most
common time keeper for effects with most of them occuring at the end of every round.

<h4>ADDITIONAL TURNS AND EXTRA ACTIONS</h4>
<p>
Creatures gain 1 additional action per round for each 4 agility, with a maximum
of 1 move and 1 standard per turn. Every additional action afterwards is added
as another turn at their initiative -5.
</p>
<p>
Examples :
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creature with 3 agility : 1 turn per round with 1 Move action.</li>
<li>Creature with 5 agility : 1 turn per round with 1 Move and 1 Standard action.</li>
<li>Creature with 8 agility : 2 turns, first with 1 Move and 1 Standard,
    and a second turn with 1 Move action.</li>
<li>Creature with 12 agility : 2 turns, 1 with i Move and 1 Standard,
    and a second with 1 Move and 1 Standard again.</li>
</ul>

<h4>COMBAT ACTIONS</h4>
<p>
As noted, creatures have only a certain amount of actions they may do on a turn.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Round Action</b> : The creature must focus and concentrate. They lose all
their turns for the round.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Action</b> : The creature forgoes their move and standard actions for the
turn to use a full action instead. If they only have a move action for the turn,
they cannot do a Full Action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Standard Action (1 per turn)</b> : The standard action, most commonly used to
attack. Can be forgone to gain an additional move action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Move Action (1 per turn)</b> : The creature moves, climbs, swims or flies.
Can be forgone to do a swift action or lesser attack action. (See combat attacks further on.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Swift Action (1 + 1 per 5 agility per turn)</b> : A short action. Can be used
alongside a move or standard action on one's turn.
</p>

<p>
<b>Immediate Action (1 +1 per 4 agility per turn)</b>: A very short action.
Can be used in reaction to enemy or allied actions even if not one's turn.
</p>

    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>COMBAT MOVEMENT</h3>
<p>
Although characters may move regularily during combat, there are a few
additional rulings and movement options that are possible using the
character's actions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Charging (1 Standard + 1 Move)</b> : A creature may choose to charge a target,
gaining +1 to their attack, instead of simply moving and attacking. This can
onlly be done if the creature has a clear line between themselves and their
target and is at least 3 tiles away.
</p>

<img src="images/rulebook-combat2-img1.png">
<p class="img-caption">
A charge cannot change direction.
</p>

<p>
<b>Changing Facing Direction (1 Immediate)</b> : A character may change their
facing direction by up to 2 tile degrees whenever a foe attempts to attack
them in order to properly face their opponent.
</p>

<img src="images/rulebook-combat2-img2.png">
<p class="img-caption">
While the creature may change direction to face B, the creature
attacking from C is too far to face in one action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prone/Standing Up</b> : A very short action. Can be used in reaction to enemy
or allied actions even if not one's turn.
</p>

<h3>DIFFICULT TERRAIN</h3>
<p>
Characters moving through difficult terrain are hindered and lose a certain
amount of their movement speed and dodge.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tame (Sand/Rocky Terrain/Undergrowth)</b> :-2 Movement (Min. 1), -1 Dodge
</p>

<p>
<b>Difficult Terrain (Brush, Marshlands, Ruin Rubble)</b> :
Half or -4 Movement (whichever is worse, Min 1), - 3 Dodge.
</p>

<p>
<b>Difficult Terrain (Quicksand)</b> : No Movement, -6 Dodge.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>ATTACKING/DEFENDING</h3>
<p>
Should a character wishes to harm another for any reason, be it with sword or bow,
the must declare an attack action. The rolls associated with attacking must be
rolled per attack, not one roll for all attacks.
</p>

<h4>ATTACKING</h4>
HIT -> STRIKE -> DAMAGE

<h4>HITTING</h4>
(ATTACK VS DODGE)
<p>
To see if an attack hits one's opponent, the attacking creature must roll against
their opponent's dodge. Compare these values on the roll chart then roll to see
what the outcome would be. (See Dice Rolls chart)
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Success</b> : The attack hits and the attacker gains 2 additional might
on their attack
</p>

<p>
<b>Success</b> : The attack hits, with no additional bonuses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Success</b> : The opponent was able to parry the blow. They add their
Parry or Blocking values to their Armour.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fail</b> : The opponent dodges the attack. The attack doesn't hit and can't
be rolled for Striking.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Fail</b> : MELEE The opponent outmaneuvers the attacker and may use an
immediate action to make an attack of opportunity. (See further)
RANGED : Fumble and drop your weapon.

<!--========================================================== Page content -->
<!--======================================================================= -->

<div class="bookpage">

<h1>COMBAT</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>STRIKING</h3>

<h3>(MIGHT VS ARMOUR)</h3>
<p>
Each attack that hits an opponent doesn't automatically deal damage. They must
rolled a second time to see if said attack goes through the opponent's armour.
Compare each attack's might and the opponent's armour on the dice rolling chart,
then roll the strikes. If it goes through, the weapon's damage is applied to the
opponent's wounds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Success</b> : The weapon's damage is increased by 1 per size difference,
with a minimum of +1.
</p>

<p>
<b>Success</b> : The weapon's damage of the attack is applied.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Success</b> : The weapon's damage is reduced by 1 per size difference,
to a minimum of 1 damage before any damage reduction calculations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fail</b> : The damage is negated.
</p>

<h3>ATTACK/STRIKING ADDITIONAL RULES</h3>
<p>
Whenever a character attacks or is attacked, there are a few minor additional
rules that come into play and may be used to their advantage.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attacks of Opportuinty</b> : Whenever an attack of opportunity is given,
the creature may use an immediate action to do a single primary attack.
</p>

<p>
<b>Alternate Attacks</b> : Some creatures may have alternate primary attacks.
Which attack is used must be chosen before rolling to hit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Secondary Attacks</b> : Some creatures may have additional secondary attacks,
such as a bite, tail or claws. These can be added to the primary attacks by
using a swift action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dual Wielding</b> : For each additional weapon held by a creature, add another
primary attack but reduce all hitting values by 1.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesser Attack</b> :A creature may use it's given move action to instead do
a lesser attack. It acts as a primary attack with -1 to it's hitting values.
</p>

<p>
<b>Flanking</b> : For each additional ally within melee range of a creature,
reduce its dodge by 1. Positioning does not matter for flanking.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attack Positioning</b> : Positioning does matter for attacking however.
See Dodge. (Combat Attributes)
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>NON-LETHAL DAMAGE</h3>
<p>
Sometimes a creature may wish to simply knock out an opponent instead of killing them.
If this is the case, the attacker counts all their roll values with lethal weaponry
as one category lower on the dice roll chart. Non-lethal weaponry ignores this
rule and rolls normally.
</p>

<h3>COMBAT MANEUVERS</h3>
<p>
Combat maneuvers are attack actions that don't deal damage, instead attempting
to displace or control the target. Combat maneuvers only need to roll the
Hitting part of the attack actions and automatically pass Striking for their effects.
</p>

<p>
<b>Size</b> : Combat maneuvers are much harder to succefully do against any size
larger than oneself. For every size larger, the opponent gains a +4 bonus to
their dodge value, and it is impossible to do any combat maneuvers against
targets 3 sizes larger.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Fail</b> : MELEE : The weapon bounces off. Drop your weapon.
RANGED : The projectile breaks upon impact.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attack Penalties</b> : Combat maneuvers usually require slightly more skill
than simply attacking the target with a club. This is per maneuver.
</p>

<h2>COMBAT MANEUVERS</h2>
Maneuver Penalty

<p>
Shove/Drag -1 per tile
Attempt to push/drag a target for a distance up to one's
total movement. Must be in melee range and remain in melee range if dragging.
</p>

<p>
Cripple -1-X
Attempt to cripple a target within attacking range, reducing movement by half
for 1+X rounds.
</p>

<p>
Trip -2
Attempt to make a target within melee range fall down and gain the prone condition.
</p>

<p>
Disarm -3.
Attempt to make a target within attacking range drop their wielded weapon.
</p>

<p>
Grapple -3
Attempt to partially grapple a target. (See Grappling)
</p>

<p>
Tackle +3
Attempt to fully grapple a target. (See Grappling) The target may use an
immediate action to get a free Striking roll with their primary attack.
</p>

<div class="bookpage">

<h1>COMBAT</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>GRAPPLING</h3>
<p>
Grappling can be initiated by two of the combat maneuvers, and unlike any other
combat maneuver results in a permanent state.
</p>

<p>
While grappled, the initiating creature and its opponent both lose partial to
full movement and lose bonuses to their Dodge. How much is depending on the
state of the grapple.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Grapple</b> : If a grapple check is successful, the target is grabbed
by the arm or leg. Both the grappler and target lose half their dodge.
The grappled target lowers their movement by half before any other movement calculations.
The two creatures drag each other whenever moving. If another grapple is successful,
the partial grapple becomes a full grapple.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Grapple</b> : If a grapple check is applied twice in a row or the target
was tackled, the grappled target may no longer move or use any limbs. The grappler
gains +5 to the Escaping Grapples check every round. If the grapple is succesful
once again, the grappler may choose to either pin or choke/constrict their target.
</p>

<p>
<b>Choke/Constrict</b> : The grappler deals i lethal damage every round, ignoring
all guarded armour bonuses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pin</b> : Pinning the target ends the grapple action and allows the grappler to
use rope or bindings to tie up the target. The target must now use their escape
artist checks against the bindings instead of strength checks against the grappler.
</p>

<p>
<b>Escaping Grapples</b> : Each round, the target and grappler must roll and add
their strength. If the target's total is greater than the grappler's, they escape.
</p>

<h3>RESOLVE</h3>
<p>
Resolve is a roll required by all characters at the start of the first turn
within a round. It uses the creature's Will as its basis and is the
representation of the flight or fight response throughout a battle.
</p>

<p>
RESOLVE 3 + Highest enemy Presence - Highest allied Presence
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Succes</b> : Lose 1 Fear point.
</p>

<p>
<b>Success</b> : Nothing happens.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Success</b> : Roll the die again.
</p>

<p>
<b>Failure</b> : Gain 1 Fear point per difference between your Will score
and the Resolve.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Failure</b> : Gain 2 Fear points per difference between your Will
score and the Resolve.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>CRITICAL WOUNDS (OPTIONAL)</h3>
<p>
If a Game Master is feeling kind, they may instead inflict critical wounds
whenever a player dies, instead leaving them with 1 lethal wound and unconscious
for the remainder of the current combat. Whenever this occurs, roll a die.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 - Eyes</b> : Blinded on one side. That side is now considered a creature's
“back” when attacked. -3 to all sight based skill checks. If it happens again,
all sides are considered the “back” and can no longer use sight.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 - Arms</b> : Limb is cut off. Halve all strength skill and grapple checks.
If no limbs remain, can no longer use strength skill checks.
</p>

<p>
<b>3 - Hips</b> : Hips are half-removed. 1 tile movement. Can't use move based
skills and actions
</p>

<p>
<b>4 - Hands</b> : Limb is cut off. Halve all dexterity based skill checks.
Can no longer use two-handed weapons. If no limbs remain, can't use dexterity
skills at all.
</p>

<p>
<b>5 - Torso</b> :-1 to all ability scores and remove utility from any additional
piece if available. (Wings, tails, spines... etc.). This critical wound can stack.
</p>

<p>
<b>6 - Head</b> : Reduce all rolls results by 1. This critical wound can stack.
</p>

<p>
