<h3>STRIKING</h3>

<h3>(MIGHT VS ARMOUR)</h3>
<p>
Each attack that hits an opponent doesn't automatically deal damage. They must
rolled a second time to see if said attack goes through the opponent's armour.
Compare each attack's might and the opponent's armour on the dice rolling chart,
then roll the strikes. If it goes through, the weapon's damage is applied to the
opponent's wounds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Success</b> : The weapon's damage is increased by 1 per size difference,
with a minimum of +1.
</p>

<p>
<b>Success</b> : The weapon's damage of the attack is applied.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Success</b> : The weapon's damage is reduced by 1 per size difference,
to a minimum of 1 damage before any damage reduction calculations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fail</b> : The damage is negated.
</p>

<h3>ATTACK/STRIKING ADDITIONAL RULES</h3>
<p>
Whenever a character attacks or is attacked, there are a few minor additional
rules that come into play and may be used to their advantage.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attacks of Opportuinty</b> : Whenever an attack of opportunity is given,
the creature may use an immediate action to do a single primary attack.
</p>

<p>
<b>Alternate Attacks</b> : Some creatures may have alternate primary attacks.
Which attack is used must be chosen before rolling to hit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Secondary Attacks</b> : Some creatures may have additional secondary attacks,
such as a bite, tail or claws. These can be added to the primary attacks by
using a swift action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dual Wielding</b> : For each additional weapon held by a creature, add another
primary attack but reduce all hitting values by 1.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lesser Attack</b> :A creature may use it's given move action to instead do
a lesser attack. It acts as a primary attack with -1 to it's hitting values.
</p>

<p>
<b>Flanking</b> : For each additional ally within melee range of a creature,
reduce its dodge by 1. Positioning does not matter for flanking.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attack Positioning</b> : Positioning does matter for attacking however.
See Dodge. (Combat Attributes)
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>NON-LETHAL DAMAGE</h3>
<p>
Sometimes a creature may wish to simply knock out an opponent instead of killing them.
If this is the case, the attacker counts all their roll values with lethal weaponry
as one category lower on the dice roll chart. Non-lethal weaponry ignores this
rule and rolls normally.
</p>

<h3>COMBAT MANEUVERS</h3>
<p>
Combat maneuvers are attack actions that don't deal damage, instead attempting
to displace or control the target. Combat maneuvers only need to roll the
Hitting part of the attack actions and automatically pass Striking for their effects.
</p>

<p>
<b>Size</b> : Combat maneuvers are much harder to succefully do against any size
larger than oneself. For every size larger, the opponent gains a +4 bonus to
their dodge value, and it is impossible to do any combat maneuvers against
targets 3 sizes larger.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Fail</b> : MELEE : The weapon bounces off. Drop your weapon.
RANGED : The projectile breaks upon impact.
</p>

<p>
<b>Attack Penalties</b> : Combat maneuvers usually require slightly more skill
than simply attacking the target with a club. This is per maneuver.
</p>

<h2>COMBAT MANEUVERS</h2>
