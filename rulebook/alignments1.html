<h1>ALIGNMENTS</h1>
<p>
For every heart of good resides one of hatred. For every servant of chaos,
there is a servant of law. The realm of Avorkarth's inhabitants are many and
varied, though all act accordingly, although loosely, to an alignment rule system.
Such is the same for any created character. Alignments are the basis of a character's
response and reaction to an event, and how it would affect them. A law abiding
character seeing a crime done right in front of them may try to sop it or inform
the local guards, while a more chaotic character may chuckle and simply watch to
see where the whole affair will go.
</p>

<p>
However, not all species are capable of any alignment, as that is a gift, or a
curse, that is mostly held by humanity. Many species in the lore book have
limitations due to their creators, gods and other influences throughout the ages.
Remember, only a human acts as a human.
