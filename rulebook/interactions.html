<h1>INTERACTIONS</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
A character's interaction with the world is shown by the use of actions,
or simply put, “the things they may do”. These actions are split into three
distinct categories, being the General actions, Skill actions and Combat actions.
</p>

<h3>ACTIONS</h3>

<h4>ACTION TYPES</h4>
<p>
Actions are how the character interacts with the world and encompass
the following :
</p>

<p>
<b>General Actions</b> : These are actions that can be done at any time,
such as drinking a potion, reading a scroll or speaking to another.
</p>

<p>
<b>Skill Actions</b> : These are general actions that have a chance of failure.
Such actions are jumping over a cliff, acting out a play or disguising oneself.
</p>

<p>
<b>Combat Actions</b> : These actions can only be done while in combat or to
begin combat such as swinging a sword or casting an offensive spell.
</p>

<h4>ACTION LENGTH</h4>
<p>
Any action takes a certain amount of time and while under stressful situations
such as combat, characters are limited in the number of actions they may do in
a given time. To easily categorize all actions, there are multiple categories
of time lengths based upon turns and rounds.
</p>

<p>
If an action takes longer than a full turn's worth, it is carried over to that
character's next turn.
</p>

<p>
<b>Move Action</b> : The base Move Action is given freely to all characters,
no matter how slow their reaction speed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Standard Actions</b> : The most common action, most characters tend to have
a single Standard Action per turn alongside their Move action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Actions</b> : Full actions are set as a static amount of time that doesn't
change no matter how quick the character is. These ALWAYS take a full round and
the character's full attention.
</p>

<p>
<b>Swift Actions</b> : These actions are quick but still take up enough time that
they cannot be done except on the turn of the character. These actions may be
done alongside a standard or move action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Immediate Actions</b> : Immediate Actions are so impressively fast that they may
be done during another creature's turn. Immediate actions often need to be
prepared ahead of time.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h4> THE TELLING ACTION</h4>
<p>
Tian watched as Uru tested her now healed sinuous tail, its fins cresting the
waters of the large pond. The lightest smile etched his face as he contemplated
her movements with his usual studious nature. It was obvious that the pond was
too small for the siren, but it didn't stop her from moving with the grace of
her oceanic predatory kind. His eyes sharpened as he caught the glimpse of her
sharpened teeth beneath the tattooed line.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a flick of the creature's hips rippling through to the end of her tail
and a wave of droplets was flying towards him, the thresher siren giving him a
mischevious grin.
</p>

<p>
Taking a quick breath, Tian exhaled and let his martial subconcious take over.
His hand and arm became a blur as they lightly touched each droplet of water
ever so gently as to divert them to either side of his body.
</p>

<p>
Uru pouted and huffed, speaking in a broken tongue. “How were you ready for that?”
</p>

<p>
"Every action has a tell before it occurs.” replied the monk with his usual
serenity, “Yours was your smile.”

<h3>MOVEMENT</h3>
<p>
Movement is the representation of how quickly a character moves through the world.
The movement attribute is generally unused outside of dangerous situations or combat.
While combat is active, movement is shown as 1 for each tile, with diagonals
counting as 1 and a half. A character can move through these tiles at the rate
of their chosen movement as long as they are not yet occupied or are of a small
enough stature.
</p>

<h4>MANEUVERABILITY</h4>
<p>
This determines the ease of travel for the character upon different terrains.
</p>

<p>
<b>Perfect</b> : The character may move freely in any direction.
</p>
<img src="images/rulebook-interactions3-img1.png" >

<p>
<b>Good</b> : The character cannot move in diagonals, but can turn direction
in the same move action.
</p>
<img src="images/rulebook-interactions3-img2.png" >

<p>
<b>Rough</b> : The character can only move in a straight line and must take
a second move action to turn.
</p>
<img src="images/rulebook-interactions3-img3.png" >

<h4>SPRINTING</h4>
<p>
A character may use two movement actions in a turn to sprint. If so used,
they may add +1 to their total movement, with an additional +1 per 5 base
movement speed.
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h4>SWIMMING/CLIMBING</h4>
<p>
Though swimming and climbing are skill actions, they are technically movement
sub-sets as well. Characters who attempt to swim through deep waters or climb
steep mountain-sides may do so only if they pass the skill check first.
</p>

<h4>FLYING</h4>
<p>
Characters that have a flying movement speed may use it instead of their running move.
Their distance from the ground (moving “up”) counts as part of the movement as
well and must be kept note of. Flight can only be used if the character is in
their Light or lower lifting capacity. (See lifting capacity.)
</p>

<h4>FALLING</h4>
<p>
Falling is commonplace in areas of danger. Cliffs, traps, ravines and ledges are
all obstacles where falling is possible. Falling penalties increase the further
the distance fallen. The penalties of the fall can be reduced by a successful
tumble skill action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Light Fall</b> : Falling dangers begin once the drop is greater than 2 tiles
more than their height. The character then takes i lethal damage per further
tile. The DC of the tumble is equal to the total number of tiles fallen.
</p>

<p>
<b>Medium Fall</b> : If a fall is greater than 5 tiles (+1 per size), then the
character instead takes 2 lethal damage per distance fallen. The DC of the
tumble is equal to the total number of tiles fallen.
</p>

<p>
<b>Great Fall</b> : If a fall is greater than 8 tiles (+1 per size), then the
character takes 4 lethal damage per distance fallen. The DC of the tumble is
equal to 2x the total number of tiles fallen
</p>

<p>
<b>Size Difference</b> : Creatures larger than medium size increase the total
damage taken by 2 per size category. Creatures smaller than medium size decrease
the total damage taken by i per size category.
</p>

<h4>BREATHING/HOLDING UNDERWATER</h4>
<p>
Most land species of Avorkath cannot breathe underwater, however may hold their
breath a number of rounds equal to their constitution score + 1 per size smaller
than medium. Afterwards, they take 1 lethal damage per round.
</p>

<h2>SKILLS</h2>
<p>
Skills are predetermined actions that the character may do, although which
require a certain amount of expertise. Unlike actions, there is a chance that
the character's ability to perform these skills isn't good enough and that the
character fails their attempt.
</p>

<h3>USING SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Skills function exactly as actions, with a certain amount of time allocated per
skill. The difference lies in the chance of failure. Unlike an action which is
simply declared, a skill must also be rolled. The roll is then checked against
the difficuly check and the outcome decided.
</p>

<h3>DIFFICULTY CHECKS (DCs)</h3>
<p>
As with all dice rolls, to know if a skill was succesful, it must be rolled
against a difficulty check. These are preset numbers that the skill value of
the roll is used against. (See Dice Rolls)
</p>

<h3>MULTIPLE ABILITY SCORES</h3>
<p>
Should a skill benefit from multiple ability scores, the character chooses
only one. These bonuses do not stack, and only the chosen ability score is used
for the skill roll.
</p>

<h3>SKILL TYPES - NATURAL SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Natural skills are ones that relies more upon the character's natural inborn
abilities. These skills aren't as heavily penalized for being untrained but
don't get as much from mastery.
</p>

<p>
NATURAL SKILL VALUE Relevant Ability Score + Mastery Bonus - 2
</p>

<h3>SKILL TYPES - LEARNED SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Learned skills can also be attempted by any character (as long as they aren't
complex), although without learning the intricacies the characterwill have a
much tougher task ahead. Learned skills have a much heavier penalty untrained
and relies upon mastery.
</p>

<p>
LEARNED SKILL VALUE Relevant Ability Score + Mastery Bonus - 5
</p>

<h3>SKILL TYPES - TRADE SKILLS</h3>
Trade skills are very similar to learned skills, however are always complex and
can only be used if they have a mastery point within.
</p>

<p>
TRADE SKILL VALUE Relevant Ability Score + Mastery Bonus - 3
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>SKILL TYPES - KNOWLEDGE SKILLS</h3>
<p>
While knowledge skills are much like learned skills for their penalty and mastery,
they also further penalties depending on the character's upbringing, backstory
and other knowledges.
</p>

<p>
KNOWLEDGE SKILL VALUE Relevant Ability Score + Mastery Bonus - 5
</p>

<p>
<b>Knowledge - World</b> : Knowledge skills are split into two categories and any
point put into said race or region category allows the character to roll for any
minor category included. These minor categories can also be further mastered.
Characters start with their own race and region of growth automatically
</p>

<p>
<b>Knowledge - Magic</b> : Knowledge Magic is split into 5 major categories, or
spheres of magic, each with specific sub-spheres. Having knowledge of magic
does not give a character magical abilities, but can be used for knowing or
using magical items.
</p>

<h3>COMPLEX SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Any skill marked as Complex are too intricate for lesser minds. A complex skill
requires that the character be of intelligence 3 or more.
</p>

<h3>LIMITED SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Skills marked as limited aren't able to be nearly as enhanced and gain much less
from any mastery. If so marked, limited skills reduce any mastery bonus by half,
rounded down.

<h2>WILL STATE</h2>
<p>
A character's will is ever important, giving them the courage to stand up
against their foes or the heart to resist the most dangerous of temptations.
However, even the most hardened veterans may fall to the terrors or charms of
battle and spells.
</p>

<p>
<b>Charm/Fear Points</b> : Whenever an effect says that the character gains a charm
or fear point, they must refer to the fright and/or charm charts to see if any
effect is yet placed on the character.
</p>

<p>
<b>Charmed and Feared</b> : Should a character be suffering a charm and fear effect
at the same time, they must suffer the effect of whichever is greater at the
moment. If they are tied, fear is the greater effect.
</p>

<p>
<b>Regaining Sanity</b> : Characters lose 1 fear and charm point per safe night's rest.
