					<h2 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:0;"><u>Actions</u></h2>	
					<!-- <h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">General Actions vs Skills</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;"> -->
					<p>A character's interaction with the world is show by the use of actions, or simply put, things they may do. This is 
					split into two distinct categories. General Actions - very simple actions which 
					the character cannot fail and which are shown in this section, and Skills which have a chance of failing, 
					sometimes with disastrous results.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Actions</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Actions are how the character interacts with the world and encompass the following :
					<br><br><b>Skill Actions</b>: such as jumping over a cliff, acting a play or disguising oneself. 
					<br><br><b>Combat Actions</b>: swinging a sword or casting an offensive spell.
					<br><br><b>General Actions</b>: drinking a potion, reading a scroll or speaking to another. 
					<br><br>Each action takes a certain amount of time which is represented by the number of actions required per round. 
					
					<br><br><i><b>Note!</b> : Don't worry about writing 
					down any general actions upon the character sheet as they are simply things that the player can tell the Game Master that they wish 
					their character to do. Skills and combat actions, on the other hand, are used alongside dice and are therefore
					tracked upon the character sheet.</i></p>					
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Action Length</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p><b> Move Action</b> : The base Move action is given freely and is not affected by swiftness. Each creature gets at least one move action
					per turn, in addition to their standard actions.
					<p><b> Standard Actions</b> : The most common action, characters have a certain amount of actions they can do depending on their
					swiftness. The cost of each Action is split into Standard Actions. </p>
					<p><b> Swift Actions</b> : These actions are quick but still take up enough time that one cannot do more than a number of
					Swift Actions per turn equal to half their actions per turn (rounded down and to a minimum of 1).</p>
					<p><b> Free Actions</b> : These actions do not cost any time whatsoever and can be done without taking place of another action
					however cannot be done during another's turn.</p>
					<p><b> Immediate Actions</b> : The actions can be done during another creature's turn. Characters
					can only do a number of Immediate Action between their turns equal to half their Swift actions (rounded down to a minimum of 1).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Actions per Turn</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Characters have so many actions per round. Actions are grouped by 2 into turns. 
					Each additional turn is slotted at the character's initiative -4.</p>					
					
					<p style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;"><b>ACTIONS PER TURN</b></p>
					<table>
						<tr><th>Agility Tier</th><th>Action/Turns per Round</th></tr>
						<tr><td>Minor Agility</td><td>1 move action*</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Lesser Agility</td><td>1 move action, 1 standard action</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Standard Agility</td><td>2 standard actions</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Greater Agility</td><td>3 standard actions</td></tr>

						<tr><td>Mythical Agility</td><td>7 standard actions</td></tr>
					</table>
					<p><i>*Should a character wish to attack with a move action, they may use what is called a lesser attack. See 
					the combat section.</i></p>
					
					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Swiftness</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Swiftness determines how often a character acts while combat is active. For each point of swiftness the
					character acts more often during combat, moving as a blur to others.
					
					<p style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;"><b>SWIFTNESS</b></p>
					<table>
						<tr><td>Agility Value/2</td></tr>
					</table>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Additional Turns</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Whenever a character has a swiftness score, the gain additional standard actions to be spent during the round. Each two standard
					actions are added as an additional turn. This turn is added for the character at their initiative -5. Should an action take 
					three or more standard actions, the character may withold their standard actions from one turn to the next, as long as they are within 
					the same round.</p>-->
