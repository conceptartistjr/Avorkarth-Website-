<h1>COMBAT ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">
<p>
While the everyday civilized creature does not have to worry about it, the realm
of Avorkarth is one of danger lurking â€˜round every corner. As such, adventurers,
heroes, villains and creatures of all kinds must fight to simply live and reap
the rewards of each further day. The combat attributes use the base ability
scores to tell how efficient the creature is at these moments of conflict.
</p>

<h2>COMBAT ATTRIBUTES</h2>

<h3>WOUNDS</h3>
<p>
Wounds is the total amount of lethal damage a character can take before dying
or falling unconscious. This is due to there being two different methods of
wounding a character, one being lethal and the other being non-lethal.
</p>

<p>
WOUNDS Constitution
</p>

<p>
<b>Unconscious</b> : If a character receives non-lethal damage equal to their
total wounds, they fall unconscious. In such a state the character cannot move,
take any actions or defend themselves.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wounded</b> : If a creature receives a certain amount of lethal wounds,
they are ever more crippled. These are known as Wounded States and carry
increasing penalties.
</p>

<p>
WOUNDED STATES (wounds rounded down)
</p>

<table>
<tr><th> State     </th><th> Wounds  </th><th>  Effect                                                     </th></tr>
<tr><td> Well      </td><td> Full    </td><td> None                                                        </td></tr>
<tr><td> Hurt      </td><td> 3/4     </td><td> -1 Movement, Dodge and Attack                               </td></tr>
<tr><td> Wounded   </td><td> 1/2     </td><td> Half Movement and Dodge, -2 Attack, -1 Might. Bleeding Out. </td></tr>
<tr><td> Crippled  </td><td> 1/10    </td><td> 1 Movement and Dodge, halve all other combat attributes.    </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>Bleeding out</b> : A truly dangerous state to be in, if a creature gains the
bleeding out state, they lose 1 wound every round thereafter until it is
healed with the heal skill or by a magical spell.
</p>

<p>
<b>Regaining Non-Lethal Wounds</b> : Characters remove 1 non-lethal damage per day.
</p>

<p>
<b>Regaining Lethal Wounds (Heal Counters)</b> : It takes a long time for wounds
to heal. Creatures gain 1 heal counter per day. When a creature has 20 heal
counters, they lose all heal counters and regain 1 wound.
</p>

<h3>INITIATIVE</h3>
<p>
Initiative determines how quickly the character reacts to combat and how swiftly
they enact their actions. It is used in combat to determine who goes first,
second and so on.
</p>

<p>
INITIATIVE Agility + (Instinct + Wisdom)/2 (rounded down)
</p>

<h3>ATTACK</h3>
<p>
The attack attribtue is used in combat to determine the effectiveness of a
character's ability with weaponry, be it sword, bow, fist, claw or maw.
However, the scores used for the values can be different, one being dextrous
precision, the other being agile speed.
</p>

<p>
MELEE ATTACK (Agility OR Dexterity + Instinct)/2 (rounded down)
</p>

<p>
RANGED ATTACK (Dexterity + Instinct)/2 (rounded down)
</p>

<h3>MIGHT</h3>
<p>
Any attack which hits the desired target must also bypass their natural or worn
armour. Might is the value used for this and is also heavily impacted by the
character's weapon.
</p>

<p>
MIGHT Strength
</p>

<h3>DAMAGE</h3>
<p>
Should a strike go through the opponent's armour, it then deals damage.
This damage is slightly modified by the character's strength, but mostly relies
on the weapon itself.
</p>

<p>
DAMAGE Strength/3 (rounded down)
