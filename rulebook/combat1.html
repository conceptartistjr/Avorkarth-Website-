<h1>COMBAT</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
From the clash of steel upon the battlefield, to duels within a gladitorial arena,
to a heroic warrior battling a drake upon a snowed mountain, combat within
Avorkarth may happen wherever the adventurer goes. Combat is replicated in
avorkarth using a turn based system and begins when the Game Master declares so,
usually upon the request of a player or an ambush from deadly creatures.
</p>

<h2>INITIATING/ENACTING COMBAT

<h4>COMBAT ORDER

<h4> A. - IF AMBUSHED</h4>
<p>
(If not, go to B.)
<ul>
<li> All creatures roll 1d6 and add their initiative, with ambushing creatures
     adding an additional +10 to their total.</li>
<li> Order all the initiatives in a list, from highest to lowest.</li>
<li> Any ambushed creature whose initiative is lower than the lowest ambushing
     creature does not act this round. - The highest initiative goes first.
     Players win ties. (Go to C.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> B. - MARK INITIATIVE</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> (If finishing an Ambush round) - Any ambushing creatures lose their
  +10 initiative bonus.</li>
<li> All creatures roll id6 and add their initiative</li>
<li> Any creature whose agility bonus is high enough adds their additional
     turns at their initiative - 5 per additional turn.</li>
<li> Order all the initiatives in a list, from highest to lowest.</li>
<li> The highest initiative goes first. Players win ties. (Go to C.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> C. - CREATURE'S TURN</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> If it is the creature's first turn in the round, they must roll their
     Resolve check.</li>
<li> The acting creature regains all standard, move, swift and immediate actions
     at the start of their first turn.</li>
<li> If a creature is doing a full round action and they have more than one turn,
     all turns are forgone and skipped unless they stop their full round action.</li>
<li> The creature may then use the equivalent of one move and one standard action,
     or one full action. (Unless specified otherwise).</li>
<li> The creature may choose to stay their actions and declare to use them another
     time, in which case their turn ends and they may re-enact their turn before
     any next creature's turn.</li>
<li> If all creatures have taken their turns - Go to D.</li>
<li> If not, repeat C. for the next creature in the initiative list.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> D. - ROUND'S END</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Enact all area, environmental and over-time effects, such as burns,
     bleeds or poisons.</li>
<li> Remove all creatures that have perished from the initiative list,
     and begin a new round with the updated initiative list.</li>
<li> The highest initiative goes first. Players win ties. (Go to C.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>TURNS VS. ROUNDS</h4>
<p>
Many effects happen either every so many turns or every so many rounds.
These are used to distinguish between different time signatures as combat occurs.

<p>
<b>Turn</b> : This is when a character does their actions, and is approximation of
a character's ability to do anything within a short amount of time.

<p>
<b>Round</b> : This is only updated once every character has acted all of their
turns. The round is an approximation of 8 seconds in real-time and is the most
common time keeper for effects with most of them occuring at the end of every round.

<h4>ADDITIONAL TURNS AND EXTRA ACTIONS</h4>
<p>
Creatures gain 1 additional action per round for each 4 agility, with a maximum
of 1 move and 1 standard per turn. Every additional action afterwards is added
as another turn at their initiative -5.
</p>
<p>
Examples :
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creature with 3 agility : 1 turn per round with 1 Move action.</li>
<li>Creature with 5 agility : 1 turn per round with 1 Move and 1 Standard action.</li>
<li>Creature with 8 agility : 2 turns, first with 1 Move and 1 Standard,
    and a second turn with 1 Move action.</li>
<li>Creature with 12 agility : 2 turns, 1 with i Move and 1 Standard,
    and a second with 1 Move and 1 Standard again.</li>
</ul>

<h4>COMBAT ACTIONS</h4>
<p>
As noted, creatures have only a certain amount of actions they may do on a turn.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Round Action</b> : The creature must focus and concentrate. They lose all
their turns for the round.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Action</b> : The creature forgoes their move and standard actions for the
turn to use a full action instead. If they only have a move action for the turn,
they cannot do a Full Action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Standard Action (1 per turn)</b> : The standard action, most commonly used to
attack. Can be forgone to gain an additional move action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Move Action (1 per turn)</b> : The creature moves, climbs, swims or flies.
Can be forgone to do a swift action or lesser attack action. (See combat attacks further on.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Swift Action (1 + 1 per 5 agility per turn)</b> : A short action. Can be used
alongside a move or standard action on one's turn.
</p>

<p>
<b>Immediate Action (1 +1 per 4 agility per turn)</b>: A very short action.
Can be used in reaction to enemy or allied actions even if not one's turn.
