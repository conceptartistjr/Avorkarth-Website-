<h1>Dice Rolls</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">

<p>
Dice rolls are the most important part of the whole game system.
Whenever a character or creature wishes to interact with the world and there
is a chance of failure, they must roll a die. This die roll is the equivalent
of the attempt as well as the result of the action, be it good... or bad.
</p>

<h2>Rolling</h2>

<h3>Roll Value</h3>
<p>
The value of a roll is dependant on the character's relevant skill or attribute
value. Unlike mahy other table-top role-playing games, the characters bonuses and
values are not added to the dies's results. Instead the value is used as a check
against the value of the action the character is attempting.
</p>

<h3>Minimum Values</h3>
<p>
Any total value (after any calculations) that is below 1 is always considered as
a value of 1.
</p>

<h3>Difficulty Check</h3>
<p>
The difficulty check for any dice roll is the oppossing value that is compared
against the roll value. Every action has a counter, be it a characters ability to
resist a charm or to dodge an incoming attack. Difficulty checks are often called
or known as "DC" for short.
</p>

<h3>Determining Outcomes</h3>
<p>
To see if a character's action was or will be successfull, they compare their roll
value against the difficulty check. They then roll a die  and compare the result
with the table below. The greater the difference between both values the more the
die's result leans towards a particular outcome.
</p>

<h3>Overpowering
<p>
If the difference between a value and the DC is 10 or more, it is considered an
automatic critical success/fail. This is considered before checking the roll table.
</p>

<h3>Role Example</h3>
<p>
A skillful thief is attempting to stealthily hide from the nearby patrolling guard.
Being skilled at hiding in shadows, they have a value of 8 for their hide action.
The guard would counter this with a spot check to see if they notice the theif's
movement. The guard has a value of 5 for their spot action.
That would mean that the spot check rolled by the guard is less than the DC
(the theif's hide). When the guard rolls their chec, a 1 would criticaly fail,
a 2 or 3 would fail, a 4 or 5 would be a partial success and a 6 would be a success.
With the die's result, they would then read the spot skill's results in the rulebook
to determine if they notice the theif or not.
