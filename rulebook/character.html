					<h2 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:0;"><u>Character Overview</u></h2>
					<!-- <h3 style="text-align: center;margin-top:0;">Character Sheet</h3> -->
					<p>Adventurer! Here you begin upon your first steps into Avorkarth. Your first task will be creating a character of your
					own imagination (within the limits of Avorkarth) who lives and breathes within the vast realm of creation. To best describe your
					avatar and make it easier to remember how skilled they are at certain tasks, you must create a <b>character sheet</b> that will hold 
					all of their attributes 
					and abilities. If you are lost or confused at the start or within sections of it all, do not worry! Keep on reading and you'll grasp
					the whole complex system to creating and playing your character as the pages unfold. </p>
					
					<p>This primary overview will go in small details about each part of the character that is required to have a readied, playable character,
					though the details are in each of their own sections throughout the manual. The easiest way to create your first character is to
					grab the character sheet and fill in each required section one at a time.</p>
					
					<p><b><i>Note</b> : For those who have played the Dungeons and Dragons table-top game or similar styled games like Pathfinder, you may find that 
					a lot of the rules
					in Avorkarth are similar. HOWEVER! There are rather many differences as well, such as the game not being self-balanced for the sake of immersion!
					(A halfling can never be as strong as an ogre, at least not without magical aid.)</i></p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Race, Age and Alignment</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The first step of creating a character would be determining their race from the plethora that inhabit the realm. Each Race shown
					within the beastiary has their own set of rules and bonuses associated as well as how they function as a species, allowing players to play almost
					any within.</p>
					<p>However!
					Avorkarth is primarily a human-based realm where humanity is by far the most populated species. Humans living within Avorkarth tend to be rather
					fearful of anything that isn't like them, nor that follow their ideals or deities. Magic and magical beings have diminished over the ages as
					millenia of darkened ages, forgotten histories and a silence from the deities means that inhuman creatures and are now very rarely 
					viewed near civilizations and very much hunted for their supposed tales of evils, many of which are true.
					There are a few inhumans which are accepted and even somewhat more commonly seen, such as the Runnoc(dwarves), Falgrii(halflings) and 
					Narei(low-elves).</p>
					
					<p>Nevertheless, your character can be of any race within the beastiary, and their rarity within the human lands is shown for each one - 
					from the common Human to the mythical Sei'yuulei.</p> 

					<p>Just keep in mind, if you do end up choosing an inhuman race, roleplay them as they are and do your best to not humanize them,
					nor go outside their allowed alignments. (They aren't human!)</p>				
				</div>
				<div class="inner-page_2">
					<br><br>
					

					
					<p><b><i>Player Tip</b> : A good practice is usually not to 
					choose a race or alignment that would conflict with your fellow adventurers or the Game Master's plan. Consult with the Game Master about your
					choice before proceeding. This usually leads to better game sessions with fewer arguments (until you argue that the GM's dice are rigged because they 
					keep rolling perfect 6's).</i></p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Might</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>Even within the many races of Avorkarth there are variations of might, champions and legendary individuals who are beyond the reach of most.
					Individuals' potential of power is known as Might. The might of a character is chosen upon character creation and affects their base 
					statistics to an extra-ordinary	amount. Might is nonetheless based upon racial bases and as such are still limited by which race the character is.
					<br> The Might levels are as follow : Average - Skilled - Exceptional - Elite - Champion - Legend - Myth</p>
					
					<br><br><i>
					<b>Note!</b> : Anything beyond "Average" might is already incredibly rare. Be mindful when creating a character and be ready to give a good reason 
					to the Game Master for any character of Exceptional might or above.</i>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Talents (Classes)</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>The character's class sums up their vocation as well as their adventuring abilities. Avorkarth's class system isn't a singular choice
					and instead is a division of talents spread out over many classes. These class talents are also divided into four categories; 
					<b>The General talents</b>, which are associated to no class in particular
					and describe those slightly above the average of the population. 
					<br><b>The Adventurer talents</b>, which are associated with truly skilled
					individuals.
					<br><b>The Elite talents</b>, which describe the peak of each classes' fields.
					<br><b>The Legend talents</b>, which represent 
					powers mastered by very few individuals throughout the realm. </p>
					<p>To gain access to the Elite classes, characters must have a certain number of Adventurer talents, and to gain access to the Legend classes, they 
					would need a certain number of Elite talents.</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Example : To gain access to the Assassin talents, the character MUST have 
					at least 2 Fighter talents as well as 2 Rogue talents. While there isn't a numerical limit to the number of talents a character can have, it is rather
					boring to play as or alongside a character without flaws. Try to match it best to your character's backstory and to not overload your character!</i></p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Level</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The character's level is a representation of how much combat experience the character has had in the past. While technically all
					characters begin at 0th level, they do not necessarily <u>have</u> to begin there. If your character's story states that 
					they are a veteran of battle, such as a mercenary
					or soldier who has trained and fought before, they'd begin at a higher level. If your character is a scholar or bard, or even
					a thief who doesn't fight his way to the riches, then
					they'd probably begin at level 0. You, as the creator of the character, may choose which level best fits the character's backstory. 
					However, each race has a specific maximum level which cannot be bypassed, representing their absolute peak of physical
					combat mastery.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Ability Scores</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Ability scores are the character's physical, instinctual and magical abilities. It represents how proficient their being is at certain tasks, such as
					being inherently strong or having a greater ability of retaining and using information. Every creature has access to the physical ability scores (Strength, 
					Agility, Dexterity, Constitution and Beauty), and instinctual ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Instinct, Charisma and Will), however the magical
					(Devotion, Arcana and Spirit) are restricted, unusable unless dictated otherwise by race, class or talent.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Attributes</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Attributes represent the character's overall capabilities and description. These attributes include scores such as the character's 
					hit points (to see how much damage they can take before dying), their attack bonuses (to see how well they handle a sword or a bow in combat),
					their defenses (their ability to dodge or block attacks), how large they are or how far they may move in a given time. 
					Attributes are based off of the character's ability scores and are more easily affected by external effects
					than said ability scores.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Actions</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Actions are how the character interacts with the world and encompass the following :
					<br><b>Skills</b>: such as jumping over a cliff or disguising oneself. 
					<br><b>Combat</b>: swinging a sword or casting an offensive spell.
					<br><b>General Actions</b>: drinking a potion or reading a scroll or speaking to another. 
					<br>Each action takes a certain amount of time which is represented by the number of actions per round. Do not worry too much about writing 
					down any general actions upon the character sheet as they are more simply things that the player can tell the Game Master that they wish to do. 
					Skills and combat actions on the other hand are used alongside dice and therefore the character's proficiency in these
					are best tracked upon the character sheet.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="inner-page_2">
					<br><br>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Skills</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Skills are a sub-section of actions whose main difference to any other action is that they must be failable. When creating a character, 
					the player will get a certain amount of skill points that they may spend as they wish to reflect their character's backstory. Certain races also 
					have benefits to certain skills due to their inborn natural abilities, such as merfolk and layunae having a bonus to the swimming skill.
					Some skills may also level the more you use them, which are specified per skill in the Skill section.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Gear</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>Gear, or equipment, is split into two categories, Combat and Non-Combat, but are essentially the same thing. It is the objects and materials
					your character lugs around as they travel throughout the realm be it treasure or trash. Each equipment that the character carries has a certain weight and 
					amount of space associated, affecting a total equipment count that the character may carry. This is dependant on the character's strength as well as their size. 
					(In ability scores and attributes respectively). Keep in mind that even equipment worn or being used still count towards the total carrying capacity of
					the character.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Magic and Spellcasting</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>Magic in Avorkarth is an absolutely rare resource. Forget about healers in every town, or potions that can cure combat wounds found around 
					every corner. Very few beings living in Avorkarth can cast spells or create enchantments and those who can are usually hidden, since they are usually 
					viewed with suspicion for being demonic or evil in nature due to their rarity. Many races, such as fae or merfolk are hunted down, 
					often mistaken for witches or warlocks and burnt out of non-casters' fears.</p> 
					
					<p>Characters that can cast magic usually do so through intense forbidden studies of the arcane laws, binding pacts with eldritch beings or are
					simply born with their race's innate abilities. 
					However, these aren't always on the same scale of power, with even the greatest studies often attaining but a fraction of the power of one
					who has an innate power. This leads to the actual ability of spellcasting.</p>
					
					<p>Spellcasting is based upon two aspects. The first is spells, which is the type of magic and its intended effect. The second is power, which is 
					the scale of the spell and how much power the caster pours into it. A shielding spell may grant a weaker caster a comforting nigh-invisible bubble
					that shelters them from a heated day, while a caster with much greater power can turn the same spell into a luminescant globe that allows them to
					shrug off a barrage of bolts and arrows or even walk through a pool of lava unharmed.</p>
					<!--Magic at its core is split into three types of magic, Divine, which is magic gifted from divine powers often used
					by priests, clerics and inquisitors, Arcane, which is magic that can alter the rules of the world, usually used by wizards, necromancers or sorcerers 
					and Spiritual, which is the root of natural life that flows throughout the world, often used by fae-folk, druids or similar natural casters. Sub-sections of
					magics, such as Elemental magics are also exsistant. Elemental magic, as an example is shared between Arcane and Spiritual, the former controlling it and
					the latter borrowing it.-->
