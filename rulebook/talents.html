					<h2 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:0px;"><u>Class Talents</u></h2>
					<!--<p style="text-align:center;font-size:15px;margin-top:0px;">(Classes)</p>-->
					<br>
					<!-- <p>Brave adventurer, what is is that you seek to be? A rare mystical mage? A sneaky thief? Or perhaps a barbarian simply bashing things with
					a weapon? Choose your specialty, or mix it up!</p> -->
					<p>There are no such thing as classes in the world of Avorkarth, instead the player may pick and choose from talents to create their 
					own character, matching as closely as possible to their backstory. 
					Want a thief who is good at sword fighting? No problem, that can be done. What about a shamanistic barbarian? Take talents from the Fighter,
					Adept and Bard classes, and you've yourself a fearsome warrior caster. Keep in mind that this is a low-magic and low powered world where
					the mystical and wondrous are exactly that.
					Even a single talent already puts a character way ahead of the average of their kind, 
					a hero or villain of some 
					repute. While a player technically could mix and match 30+ class feats to create a really powerful character, keep in mind that to be as such 
					would be nigh impossible according to lore and the backstory of that character will need a good reason for such speciality.</p>
					<!--
					<p>Class feats are separated into six. General, Adventurer, Elite, Champion, Legend and Mythic. While General talents can be picked
					even by beasts
					and low-intelligence creatures (as long as it works with the creature type), the Adventurer talents and greater require that the character
					be of intelligence of 2 or more. Other requirements are on a per class basis.</p>
				
					<p><i><b>Player Note!</b> : Please note that </i></p>
					-->
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Class Requirements</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Any class talents of greater power require a certain amount of previous talents from the earlier classes
					as well as the right amount of ability scores. An example
					would be the Assassin class talents. Before a character can take any assassin class talents, they'd need at minimum 2 of the rogue 
					talents and 2 of the fighter talents. Any required class talents DO count towards this total.</p>
					
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Racial and Locked Classes</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>There are many classes that are designed to a certain civilization or racial upbringing. These talents are locked to any that was
					not brought up in that society. A few other class talents can only be taken by certain races. These particular classes are 
					often magical or deity driven in nature,
					locked to the inner talents or specialities of that race and require more than simply being brought up in their society. 
					An example of such are the crystalguards of the sanguinnars, who use their crystalline implants or the matronal tidesingers of the 
					thresher sirens who have specialized vocal chords.</p>
					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">General Talents</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Every creature of every race within the realm of creation has their own specialties, quirks or passions that define them
					for who they are. General talents represent the bonuses or advantages that any and all find themselves aquiring over their lifetime.
					While these bonuses aren't as specific as the class talent categories, general talents can still impact a character quite impressively.
					-->
				</div>
				
				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Rulebook Classes</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The classes withing the rulebook are, although rare, the most common classes found within avorkarth and describe more 
					a general direction for the character. These classes' more specialized and powerful versions can be found within the lorebook
					and will be shown under each race's specialties.</p>
					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Adventurer Talents</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Once in a while, a path opens up to certain individuals and they find themselves lured to a way of life full of trials and the difficulties
					of the world. However, no matter their path, these are things all can learn with effort and training. The Adventurer classes are the primary 
					classes of the world from which the player can pick and choose bonuses to create their character's speciality.</p>				
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Elite Talents</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>While the adventurer classes are the most common of the uncommon, there are specialized classes that are greatly respected or feared and
					for good reason. As an example, should one have enough fighter class feats and greater ability scores, this gives them the opportunity to 
					be a Knight, who has given their 
					early life to training in the art of sword and shield. Characters may only have feats from up to five elite classes at once.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Champion Talents</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The champions of races and species, these classes are often guarded methods of combat and specialties specific to
					a race or alliance of people. These are the few fearsome Thrakan Highlanders whose life is dedicated to getting stronger by travelling the 
					most dangerous wilds or the Sorcerous priests of Sharas who keep the secrets of 
					the gods known as the magi. The player can only have feats from up to three chapmion classes at once.</p>					
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Legend Talents</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Legend classes are specialities from the races whom only the greatest of their kind can attain, and as such are immensely rare, respected
					and not to be crossed. Such examples are the legendary masters of wuxia from the Jian lands who rumors have it can take on a small army
					by themselves, the mythical sei'yuulei moonglaives who protect the natural shrines of the world or the everlasting velafraen sunlords
					who guide the sanguinnars' civilization. Legend classes function just like the champion classes, but have additional bonuses, stats or 
					rules that makes them truly fearsome. The player character cannot pick feats from more than one legend class.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Mythic Talents</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Only a few who are of the Mythic class ever walk the realm as a whole. These beings are born with greater power, often
					gifted by deities or blessed by ancient laws. The most known of all mythic class individuals are the enchanters, of which their unexplained
					natural ease with arcane might can topple kingdoms, but of which there are no more than 5 ever living at once.</p> -->
					
					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Class Bonuses</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Class bonuses are ability score bonuses given by the class once at least the required class talent is chosen. These class bonuses 
					do not stack from multiple classes and only the best is taken. These bonuses cannot
					be used to exceed the character's chosen race's ability score limit, unless...
					
					<br><b>Mighty Class Bonuses</b> : If a class bonus has an (M) beside it, it dictates that the character may use the class
					bonus to go beyond even the racial upper limit.</p> -->
		
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Required Class Talents</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Any class talent that has (Req.) before its name MUST be taken as the first talents of the class. These cannot be bypassed or skipped.
					After the required class talents are picked, the player may choose any of the remaining class talents, or even none at all
					if all they wished for was the class bonus and required talents. Unless it is specifically stated,
					characters cannot pick two talents that have the same name.
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Class Rarity</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>While technically almost all classes are available, other than those locked to particular races and species, there are some rarer than
					others. The rarity, in approximation, is as follows :
					<br> - (C)Common - 1 in every 250
					<br> - (U)Uncommon - 1 in every 2,500
					<br> - (R)Rare - 1 in every 25,000
					<br> - (F)Fabled - 1 in every 250,000
					<br> - (L)Legendary - 1 in every 1,000,000
					<br> - (M)Mythical - Only a few in the realm of creation.
					</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Adventurer Classes</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>This rulebook will give a few general talents to choose from, as well as the most basic of the classes.
					The Lore book holds the many additional, rarer or race specific classes to choose from such as the mythical Sei'yule Moonglaives
					or the legendary chosen arcanic wielders, the Enchanters. (At least it will in time)</p>
