# MASTERY

{{< snippet >}}<div class="bookpage-columns"><div class="bookpage-column">{{< /snippet >}}

Avorkarth is a more settled world, where the mighty and magical are rare and the
skilled are just that, skilled, nothing more. Mastery represents the character's
ability and practice in certain skills compared to the rest of its own species
through determination and practice.

Although mastery may not give a weak character the ability to level mountains,
a character with mastered skill has a much high chance of success in their field
of expertise.

### MASTERY CATEOGRIES
Mastery is considered split into three possible categories, each giving separate
bonuses based upon the number of years that the character has spent dedicating
their craft.

**Natural Skills** : Natural skill mastery can only ever be increased by so much,
due to their bonus coming from the creature's natural abilities.
(See Skills/Maximum Mastery).

**Learned/Knowledge Skills** : Learned and Knowledge Skill mastery, while having
a harder and longer learning curve, have a greater potential.

**Trade Skills** : Trade Skills, much like Weapon/Combat mastery, is on a per
trade basis, but certain trades overlap or give bonuses elsewhere.
(See Skills section) (Trade skills aren't yet implemented)

**Weapon/Combat** : Mastery in combat is determined by a character's ability
to wield weapons and their determination towards a specific combat style.
Each weapon mastery gives X amount of combat mastery, which then also gives
additional bonuses.

### MAXIMUM MASTERY
While the experience to gain a mastery bonus to a skill is nearly consistent
for all creatures, not all have the same lifespan or natural aptitude.

Therefore, a character's mastery must be split with however how many years
they have been alive.

**Natural Skills** : Natural skills also have the penalty of being limited by
the creature's natural aptitudes. Natural skills can only gain bonuses up
to half of the creature's related ability score.
