					<h2 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:0;"><u>Overview</u></h2>
					
					<p>Here you begin upon your first steps into Avorkarth. Your first task as a player will be creating a character of your
					own imagination (within the limits of Avorkarth) who lives and breathes within the vast realm of creation. To best describe your
					avatar and to remember their ability at certain tasks, it is best to fill out a character sheet. These can be found
					for free at Avorkarth.com. This sheet will hold all of the character's attributes, numbers and abilities for constant reference.</p>
					
					<p>This primary overview will go quickly through each part of the requirements to have a readied, playable character.
					The details to these parts are in each of their own sections throughout the manual. The easiest way to create your first character is to
					grab the character sheet and fill in each required section one at a time. If you are lost or confused at the start or within any section, 
					do not worry! Keep on reading and you'll grasp
					the whole complex system to creating and playing your character as the pages unfold. </p>
					
					<p><b><i>Player Tip!</b> : Before starting to create your first character, it'd be
					best to read through the <b>Base</b> sections, and to learn how the character's statistics are calculated. </i></p>
					
					<!--
					<p><b><i>Note!</b> : For those who have played the Dungeons and Dragons table-top game or similar styled games like Pathfinder, you may find that 
					a lot of the rules in Avorkarth will be familiar. However, there are rather many differences as well, such as the game not being self-balanced
					for the sake of immersion! A halfling can never be as strong as an ogre, at least not without magical aid.</i></p>-->
					
					<h4 style="text-align:center;">BASE ESSENTIALS</h4>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Ability Scores</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Ability scores are the representations of the character's physical, intellectual and instinctual abilities. They show how 
					naturally proficient
					the character is at certain tasks, such as being inherently strong or having a greater ability of retaining and using information. These
					are separated into four categories. Action, Mind, Social and Leadership. The ability scores are the most important part of every 
					character and greatly influence the rest of their attributes.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Attributes</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Attributes, based off of the ability scores, represent the character's overall capabilities and active description. These attributes
					include scores such as the character's 
					health and hit points (to see how much damage they can take before dying), their attack bonuses (to see how well they handle a sword or a 
					bow in combat),
					their defenses (their ability to dodge and evade attacks), or even things such as how large they are, how far they move in a given
					amount of time or even amount of languages known.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br>
					<h4 style="text-align:center;">CHARACTER CREATION</h4>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Race or Species</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The first step of creating a character would be determining their species/race from the plethora that inhabit the realm.
					Any and ALL species within the world lore are playable with their own set of rules and bonuses, and a description of how
					they function as a species, allowing a great amount of choice for your character. </p>
					
					<p>Note however, Avorkarth is primarily a human-based realm, and the humans living within tend to be rather
					fearful of anything unlike them and of those who do not follow their ideals and deities. Magic and magical beings have diminished over the 
					ages with the rise of humanity and its millenia of crusades and wars, alongside forgotten histories and a silence from the deities.
					This has made inhuman creatures very rarely
					viewed near civilization, and very much hunted for their supposed tales of evils, many of which are true.</p>
					<p>There are a few inhuman races which more commonly seen and even somewhat accepted, such as the Runnoc(dwarves), Falgrii(halflings) and 
					Narei(low-elves).</p>
					
					<p>Nevertheless, your character <b>can</b> be of any race or species. Just keep in mind that if you do end up choosing an inhuman race, 
					roleplay them as they are and do your best to not humanize them, nor go outside their allowed alignments. They aren't human!</p>	

					<p><b><i>Player Tip!</b> : The rulebook's race section
					holds the most common adventuring races, which are recommended for newcomers and traditional adventures. The remainder
					can be found in the Lorebooks.</i></p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Alignment</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>Alignments are the general guidelines of how your character would act upon a situation requiring their views of good, evil, law
					or chaos. Assigning an alignment will aid you in determining your characters actions in a pinch. Just keep in mind that there are certain
					races and species that have a few alignments locked to them.</p>
					
					<p><b><i>Player Tip!</b> : A good practice is usually to not 
					choose a race or alignment that would conflict with your fellow adventurers or the Game Master's plan. Consult with the Game Master about your
					choice before proceeding. This usually leads to better game sessions with fewer arguments (until you argue that the GM's dice are rigged 
					because they keep rolling perfect 10's).</i></p>

					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Might</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>Even within the many races of Avorkarth, individuals vary, champions and legends whose skills
					and abilities are beyond most.
					An individuals' potential of power is known as Might. The might of a character is chosen upon character creation and affects their base 
					statistics as well as their highest class talents available. Might is nonetheless based upon racial bases and as such is still limited 
					by which race the character is.</p> -->
					


					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Class Talents</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>The character's class talents sums up their vocation as well as their adventuring abilities. Avorkarth's class system isn't a singular
					choice and instead is a division of talents spread out over many classes from which the player can pick and choose
					as long as their race is able to reach this potential of power.
					The class talents are divided into six categories.</p>
					
					<p><i><b>Player Tip!</b> : Anything beyond the average being is rare and even acquiring a single talent grants that gap of power.
					Be mindful of this when creating a character and be ready to give
					a good backstory to the Game Master for a character of greater might.</i></p>	
					
					<p><b>The General talents</b>, which are associated to no class in particular
					although describe abilities that rise individuals above the average of the population.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>The Adventurer class talents</b>, which are associated with individuals of incredible skill compared to the average population.
					<br> Examples : Rangers, Fighters, Rogues...
					<br><br>
					
					<b>The Elite class talents</b>, which describe the elite of each adventurer classes' fields, those who have surpassed their
					own limits.
					<br> Examples :  Assassins, Thieves, Knights...
					<br><br>
					
					<b>The Champion class talents</b>, extolling the might of the champions of each race. These classes are often locked to certain
					races or species.
					<br> Examples : Wavesingers, Highlanders, Crystalguards...
					<br><br>
					
					<b>The Legend class talents</b>, which represent the rare individuals able to single handedly sway battlefields.
					<br> Examples : Sorcerers, Paladins, Grand Inquisitors... 
					<br><br>
					
					<b>The Mythic class talents</b>, which are powers wielded by only a handful of individuals that roam the realm.
					<br> Examples : Moonglaives, Wuxia Grandmasters, Enchanters...
					<br>
					
					<p><i><b>Note!</b> : While there isn't a numerical limit to the number of talents a
					character can have, it can be rather frustrating for others to play alongside a character without flaws. Try your best to match 
					the talents you choose to your character's backstory and to not overload your character with too many talents of differentiating
					roles!</i></p>

					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Combat Level</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The character's level is a representation of how much combat experience the character has had in the past. While 0th level is the
					basis for all creatures, characters do not necessarily begin there when created. If your character's backstory states that 
					they are a veteran of battle, such as a mercenary
					or soldier who has trained and fought before, they'd begin at a higher level. If your character is a scholar or bard, or even
					a thief who doesn't fight his way to the riches, then
					they'd probably begin at level 0.</p>
					<p> You, as the creator of the character, may choose which level best fits the character's backstory.
					Note, however, that each race and species has a specific maximum level representing their
					absolute peak of physical combat mastery, due to the length of time given to them within the realm.</p> -->
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Mastery</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Levels are not a thing in Avorkarth. Instead it is based upon a mastery system. The longer a character has spent upon
					a skill, be it diplomacy or combat based, the better they are at such actions. If your character's backstory states that 
					they are a veteran of battle, such as a mercenary
					or soldier who has trained and fought before, they'd have mastery within combat based skills. If your character is a scholar or bard, 
					or even
					a thief who doesn't fight his way to the riches, then
					they'd probably spend their mastery upon skill sets that would benefit their backstories.
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Equipment</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>Equipment is split into many categories. Adventuring gear, armours, weapons and so on, they are all simply
					the objects carried by your character to aid them on their quests and adventures throughout the realm. 
					<br>Each carried equipment has a certain
					weight and space associated, affecting a total equipment count that the character may carry. This is dependant on the character's
					strength as well as their size. Keep in mind that even worn or wielded equipment
					still count towards the total carrying weight capacity of the character.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Magic and Spellcasting</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0">
					<p>Magic in Avorkarth is an incredibly rare thing, most don't believe it even exists. Forget about healers in every town, or potions 
					that can cure combat wounds found around 
					every corner. Very few beings living in Avorkarth can cast spells or create enchantments and those who can are usually hidden, since they are
					usually viewed with suspicion for being demonic or evil in nature due to the powers they can wield. 
					Avorkarth is not kind to casters and many natural casting races such as the fae are hunted down or killed on sight, often mistaken for witches or 
					daemons due to the general populace's fears.</p> 
					
					<p>Characters that can cast magic do so either through intense forbidden studies of the arcane laws, binding pacts with eldritch beings
					or with their race's innate abilities. 
					<!--However, these aren't on the same scale of power, with even the greatest studies often attaining but a fraction of the power of one
					who has an innate power.--></p>
					
					<p>Spellcasting itself is based upon two aspects. The first is the spell, which is the type of magic and its intended effect. The second is 
					power, which
					is the scale of the spell and how much power the caster pours into it. A shielding spell may grant a weaker caster a comforting nigh-invisible
					bubble that shelters them from a heated day, while a caster with much greater power can turn the same spell into a luminescant globe that
					allows them to shrug off a barrage of arrows or even walk through a pool of lava unharmed.</p>
