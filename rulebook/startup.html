<h1>START-UP</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
Welcome to Avorkarth, a realm of low-fantasy adventure.
This rulebook will aid players in setting up a role-playing session (
known as a campaign or adventure) based within the realm of Avorkarth
and will give an understanding of the many ways the players may manipulate or 
interact with the world they find themselves in.
</p>

<p>
Long time table-top players may find this game is not quite as mechanically balanced
as similar table-top games out there, with the idea of instead being more immersive.
</p>

<p>
Each section of the rulebook will tend to a specific set of rules that defines what
actions or choices the player's character may take. If this is the first time that
a player will enter into the realm of Avorkarth, it is highly recommended that
they read the rulebook even if they've previously played other similar table-top
role-playing games.
</p>

<h2>Base Requirements</h2>

<h3>Players (Recommended: 3 to 7)</h3>
<p>
The players of Avorkarth are separated into two categories.
</p>

<p>
<b>Game Master/Dungeon Master (GM/DM)</b>: A single player takes the role of arbitrator for the current
and future sessions, known as the Game Master. Their role is to control all
non-player characters, creatures and challenges and are also in charge of creating
and/or setting the stage for the adventure that the remaining players will go through.
</p>

<p>
<b>Adventurers</b>: The remaining players each control a single character, usually of
their own creation, and are tasked with finishing the goal given by the
Game Master with the skills and abilities of their controlled character. Keep in mind
that Avorkarth is meant to be immersive and therefore open to be won in many ways and 
with different groups of characters, not always with characters famed in
bloodshed and swordplay.
</p>

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>Required Tools</h3>
<p>
Avorkarth is based upon traditional paper and pencil role-playing games, and as
such may be fully played as along as players have access to six-sided dice and a method
of jotting down information such as a pad of paper. With the advancement of technology,
there are many dice-rolling programs/apps and tablets are fantastic to record information.
</p>

<h3>Area of Play</h3>
<p>
While playing around a table with friends is an incredible experience, it is also
entirely possbile to play with others from around the world using online voice-chat
systems. There are even many websites and digital programs dedicated to recreating
table-top like experiences.
</p>

<h3>6 Sided Dice</h3>
<p>
Avorkarth uses 6 sided dice as its main playing component, with rolling dice
representing the randomality of life for most characters actions. Should a character
wish to jump, charm, sooth, tend, attack or do any other action in which the
result is not wholly predictable, they would roll the required amount of dice and
compare the results with the dice-rolling charts to know if they've succeeded.
</p>

<h3>Adventurers - Character Sheets</h3>
<p>
Players who take on the role of adventurer need to create and take control of
a single character, an avatar of their own will within the realm. These characters
do not necessarily represent the player themselves, but rather are a character
of their own. They can have their own personality, set of skills,
strengths or weaknesses of completely unrelated note to their player.
Most information for the character creation process, other than the rules, is found
in the World Lore section and book.

<h1>DICE ROLLS</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
Dice rolls are the most important part of the whole game, used for almost all interactions.
Whenever a character or creature wishes to interact with the world and there
is a chance of failure, they must roll one or more dice. This die roll is the equivalent
of the attempt as well as the result of the action, be it good... or bad.
</p>

<h2>Rolling</h2>

<h3>Roll Value</h3>
<p>
The value of a roll is dependant on the character's relevant skill or attribute
value. Unlike mahy other table-top role-playing games, the characters bonuses and
values are not added to the dies's results. Instead the value is used as a check
against the value of the action the character is attempting, known as a 
Difficulty Check.
</p>

<h3>Minimum Values</h3>
<p>
Any roll value (after any calculations) that is below 1 is always considered as
a value of 1. (So should a caculation lead to a roll value of -2, it is counted as 1).
</p>

<h3>Difficulty Check</h3>
<p>
The difficulty check for any dice roll is the opposing value that the roll value is
compared to. Every action has a counter, be it a characters ability to
resist a charm or to dodge an incoming attack. Difficulty checks are often called
"DC"s for short.
</p>

<h3>Determining Outcomes</h3>
<p>
To see if a character's action was successfull, they compare their roll
value against the difficulty check. They then roll a die and check the result
with the table below. The greater the difference between the roll value and the Difficulty
Check, the more the die's result leans towards a particular outcome.
</p>
<h3>Roll Example</h3>
<p>
A skillful thief is attempting to stealthily hide from the nearby patrolling guard.
</p>
<!--<h3>Overpowering</h3>
<p>
If the difference between a value and the DC is 10 or more, it is considered an
automatic critical success/fail. This is considered before checking the roll table.
</p> -->

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
<li>Being skilled at hiding in shadows, the thief has a value of 8 for their hide action.
<li>The guard would counter this by rolling a spot check to see if they notice the theif's
movement. The guard has a value of 5 for their spot action.
<li>So the Difficuly Check (thief | 8) is 3 higher than the roll (guard | 5).
<li>By checking the table below, one notes that the guard would need to roll at least
a 5 to get a partial success and catch a glimpse of the thief.
