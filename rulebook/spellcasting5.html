# SPELLCASTING

### CASTING THE SPELL
Spellcasting is a very drastic thing, for it essentially overwrites the rules of
the realm to produce a desired effect. Such changes cannot be done without the
caster being able to handle the repercussions. As such, casters ought to be weary
when casting a spell, for the after-effects upon themselves can range from splitting
headaches to violently being torn apart in an instant death. Whenever a spell is
finished casting and is released, the caster must roll a die with their caster
level for the particular spell as the roll value, much like an attack,
and compare to the spell's difficulty check.

#### SPELL DIFFICULTY CHECK - (VS. Updated Caster Level)
Spell level x 2 (Minimum 1)

**Critical Success/Success** : The spell goes through normally.

**Partial Success** : The spell casts, but the caster takes 1 non-lethal damage.
Additionaly, they take non-lethal damage equal to the spell’s DC - their caster level.

**Failure** : The spell fails to cast. The caster takes 1 lethal damage.
Additionally, the caster takes lethal damage equal to the spell’s DC
- their caster level.

**Critical Failure** : The spell fails to cast. The caster takes 2 lethal damage.
Additionally, the caster takes lethal damage equal to the spells DC x 2
- their caster level.

### COUNTERSPELLING
Whenever a spell is begun, the surge of energy that occurs is naturally felt by
any other caster nearby. This allows other casters to counter the spell being
cast and they may attempt to dispel it by spending their reserve as if they cast
the spell. The counterspeller may spend their lifeforce to attempt to cancel or
dispel a spell. For every point of reserve higher than their total reserve pool,
the caster takes 1 lethal damage.

Counterspelling may be done at two separate points in time. Before the spell is
cast OR as the spell is cast.

**Counterspelling beforehand** : This counterspelling can only be cast as an amount
of time less than the original caster's amount of time spent, with the equivalent
action caster level penalty. The original caster need not roll to see if a penalty
occurs, as the spell automatically fails. If a spell is cast as an immediate action,
it can only be countered as it is cast. (See below)

**Counterspelling as the spell is cast** : The counterspelling caster must spend
reserve equal to the cost of the spell being cast as if it were being cast from
their caster level as an immediate time. (So at caster level -2).
This counterspelling type can only be done if the original caster's spell
is successful.

### PERMANENT SPELLS
Most spells can be made permanent without the caster requiring to keep their
concentration, however the cost to do so is tremendous. Any spell, enchantment
or similar effect that is to be permanent (such as creating a magical weapon),
increases the cost at -10 caster might. Most often it takes a ritual to do any
such effect.

### SPELLCASTING EXAMPLE
A foolish youthful adept believes his power to be so great that he attemps to
overtake a nymph's lake.

* The adept's caster level is 2, and he therefore has 9 reserved power,
  quite impressively powerful for a human.
* He takes his time to cast the spell, an hour to be precise, believing himself
  to be hidden. This increases his caster level to 4 for this spell.
* He decides to risk it and cast the most powerful spell he can, a 2nd level
  spell, which as a 4th level caster will cost 6 of his reserves.
* A 2nd level spell has a spell difficulty of 4 (2x2), and as he releases his spell,
  he must roll against this check with his spellcaster level for this spell (4).
* The adept rolls his die and gets a 4, which is a partial success. He therefore
  gets a slight backlash, taking 3 non-lethal damage, almost knocking him unconscious
  (1 base + 2 for the difference between his caster level (2) and the spell difficulty (4)
* Being a partial success the spell goes through... except that the nymph had felt
  the surge and counters it.
* The female sei'yuulei has a natural base caster
  level of 4, and therefore 13 reserved power.
* She counters the spell as it is cast, making the caster deal with the non-lethal
  consequences. This forces her to counterspell as an immediate action, so a -2
  penalty is applied to her caster level, bringing it down to a 2 for the calculations.
* To cast a 2nd level spell as a 2nd level caster takes 12 of her 13 reserves,
  and so she doesn't take any lethal damage as overcost.
* With both casters pretty much exhausted in terms of their casting reserves,
  the angered nymph slaughters the unarmored human with ease using her teeth
  and claws for trespassing upon her glade uninvited.
