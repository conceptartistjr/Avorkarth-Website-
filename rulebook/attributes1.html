# GENERAL ATTRIBUTES

{{< snippet >}}<div class="bookpage-columns"><div class="bookpage-column">{{< /snippet >}}

Attributes are a creature's ability to affect their surroundings and be affected
by the world's obstacles. Such examples are how quickly or nimbly a character
may move or how many wounds they can take before they are downed.

## WORLD SIZE

### TILE SIZE
Size represents the approximation of how much space a creature or object takes
upon the field, be it through height or width. This is generalized into categories
that can be fitted upon Avorkarth's tile system. Each tile represents about
1.5 meters or -5 feet.

A medium creature such as a human takes up 1 tile, being approximately 1.5 meters tall. A large creature such as an ogre
takes up 4 tiles (2x2).

### SIZE CATEGORIES
A creature's placement upon the field is based upon their approximate size as
noted above. These categories offer different bonuses and penalties.
| SIZE         |  SPACE               |   REACH         |
|:------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------:|

| Small        |  2 per tile          |   1 tile        |
| Medium       |  1-3 tiles           |   1 tile        |
| Large        |  4+ tiles (2x2)      |   2-3 tiles     |
| Huge         |  16+ tiles (4x4)     |   4-6 tiles     |
| Gargantuan   |  49+ tiles (7x7)     |   7-11 tiles    |
| Colossal     |  144+ tiles (12x12)  |   12-24 tiles   |
