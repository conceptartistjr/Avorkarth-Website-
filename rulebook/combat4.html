<h1>COMBAT</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">

<h3>GRAPPLING</h3>
<p>
Grappling can be initiated by two of the combat maneuvers, and unlike any other
combat maneuver results in a permanent state.
</p>

<p>
While grappled, the initiating creature and its opponent both lose partial to
full movement and lose bonuses to their Dodge. How much is depending on the
state of the grapple.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Grapple</b> : If a grapple check is successful, the target is grabbed
by the arm or leg. Both the grappler and target lose half their dodge.
The grappled target lowers their movement by half before any other movement calculations.
The two creatures drag each other whenever moving. If another grapple is successful,
the partial grapple becomes a full grapple.
</p>

<p>
<b>Full Grapple</b> : If a grapple check is applied twice in a row or the target
was tackled, the grappled target may no longer move or use any limbs. The grappler
gains +5 to the Escaping Grapples check every round. If the grapple is succesful
once again, the grappler may choose to either pin or choke/constrict their target.
</p>

<p>
<b>Choke/Constrict</b> : The grappler deals i lethal damage every round, ignoring
all guarded armour bonuses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pin</b> : Pinning the target ends the grapple action and allows the grappler to
use rope or bindings to tie up the target. The target must now use their escape
artist checks against the bindings instead of strength checks against the grappler.
</p>

<p>
<b>Escaping Grapples</b> : Each round, the target and grappler must roll and add
their strength. If the target's total is greater than the grappler's, they escape.
</p>

<h3>RESOLVE</h3>
<p>
Resolve is a roll required by all characters at the start of the first turn
within a round. It uses the creature's Will as its basis and is the
representation of the flight or fight response throughout a battle.
</p>

<p>
RESOLVE 3 + Highest enemy Presence - Highest allied Presence
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Succes</b> : Lose 1 Fear point.
</p>

<p>
<b>Success</b> : Nothing happens.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Success</b> : Roll the die again.
</p>

<p>
<b>Failure</b> : Gain 1 Fear point per difference between your Will score
and the Resolve.
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Failure</b> : Gain 2 Fear points per difference between your Will
score and the Resolve.
</p>

<h3>CRITICAL WOUNDS (OPTIONAL)</h3>
<p>
If a Game Master is feeling kind, they may instead inflict critical wounds
whenever a player dies, instead leaving them with 1 lethal wound and unconscious
for the remainder of the current combat. Whenever this occurs, roll a die.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 - Eyes</b> : Blinded on one side. That side is now considered a creature's
“back” when attacked. -3 to all sight based skill checks. If it happens again,
all sides are considered the “back” and can no longer use sight.
</p>

<p>
<b>1 - Arms</b> : Limb is cut off. Halve all strength skill and grapple checks.
If no limbs remain, can no longer use strength skill checks.
</p>

<p>
<b>3 - Hips</b> : Hips are half-removed. 1 tile movement. Can't use move based
skills and actions
</p>

<p>
<b>4 - Hands</b> : Limb is cut off. Halve all dexterity based skill checks.
Can no longer use two-handed weapons. If no limbs remain, can't use dexterity
skills at all.
</p>

<p>
<b>5 - Torso</b> :-1 to all ability scores and remove utility from any additional
piece if available. (Wings, tails, spines... etc.). This critical wound can stack.
</p>

<p>
<b>6 - Head</b> : Reduce all rolls results by 1. This critical wound can stack.
</p>

<p>
Multi/Single Limbs: If a creature has more than 2 appendages, the GM may choose
how to apply the negatives at a reduced rate. If they have only a single limb
(like a tail for legs), automatically apply the full penalty.
