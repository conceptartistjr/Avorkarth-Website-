### RITUALS
Not all casters are powerful enought to cast spells of greater effect, and most
aren't able to cast anything at all. However, with the aid of the right words,
movements, prayers and ingredients, characters may empower their capabilities
beyond what is normally available to them. Rituals may also be empowered by
multiple people gaining ever greater might, which have in the past enabled cults
to raze the cities of their enemies with magical plagues or to awaken and control
eldritch creatures deep within the earth. Spells that are quickly cast, such as
fireballs or rays, often have the ritual empower an object like an arrow, staff
or wand.

Most rituals are arcane based deals done with creatures of darker desires such
as daemons and malevolant beings. Devotion and spirit variants are rarer and
require the user to be attuned to a powerful spirit or deity of the sphere of
magic they are attempting to cast.

**Ritual costs** : Rituals are often an aid to powers, not necessarily an
inherent power. A ritual begins when a spell cannot be cast in less than 1 hour,
and its costs increase algorithmically the further the power of the spell is
from the casting ritualist. For each reserve cost required to cast a spell,
increase the total time by an additional i.

#### RITUAL COSTS (required reserve/2) (1+required reserve).

**Additional Ritualists** : For each additional person joining a ritual,
the casting time is reduced by their total reserves. If a ritualist joins after
the casting has already begun, calculate the total amount of time required,
then reduce it by the amount of time already spent on the ritual.

**Caster Benefits** : Actual casters may reduce the total reserve required for
a ritual by casting what they can at +2 of their caster might instead of their
base caster might.

**Power Control** : The further a spell is from the caster's ability, the
greater the danger. For each point of reserve the spell is greater than all
of the ritualits' reserve total + 10, they roll a die. On a 2 or less,
they take 1 point of lethal damage as feedback. Should all the ritualists
are slain by the ritual, the spell is cancelled and a feedback occurs.

**Stopping/Resuming** : Rituals can only be paused at intervals of hours.
Stopping early or late would result in the spell failing and a feedback
would happen.

**Feedback** : A failed ritual will explode with feedback energy. The feedback
of the ritual deals 2 lethal points of damage per level of the spell to all
creatures within X tiles per level of the spell + 1 multiplied by the spell
level twice over, with a minimum of 1 lethal damage at a distance of 1 tile.
(So a level 3 spell feedback would deal 6 lethal damage (3X2) to all creatures
within 36 tiles (4x3x3).)

### RITUAL EXAMPLE
Three village women, suspected as witches, decide to take out their frustration
by actually casting a spell. Though none have any magical capabilities, one of
them has heard of a ritual passed down by her grandmother.

* Since none of the three women have any spellcasting abilities, they all have
  a caster level of Non-Caster and a power reserve of 1.
* The ritual is a weak one, casting a oth level spell to change the colour of
  the lying villager's favourite ring. Therefore the cost of a oth level spell
  for a non-caster is 12 reserve.
* With each of them having a total reserve of 1, they reduce the cost of the
  spell by 3 before the time calculations. This brings the cost down to 9.
* A ritual of 9 reserve is in total 45 hours (9/2)x(1+9), or more simply
  (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9). This will make the ritual take a bit less than two days.
* Although none of them have any casting experience, they are lucky to be three,
  as their combined reserve + 10 is 13. This means they are powerful enough to
  control the 12 reserve spell and do not run the chance of being consumed by the spell.
* Once the ritual done, the spell is cast successfully.

Rituals are often scoffed at as being superstition and fakery. It is,
however, used often as evidence to burn those under suspect.
