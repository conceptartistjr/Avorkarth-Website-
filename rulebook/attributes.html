<p>
Attributes are a creature's ability to affect their surroundings and be affected
by the world's obstacles. Such examples are how quickly or nimbly a character
may move or how many wounds they can take before they are downed.
</p>

<h2>WORLD SIZE</h2>

<h3>TILE SIZE</h3>
<p>
Size represents the approximation of how much space a creature or object takes
upon the field, be it through height or width. This is generalized into categories
that can be fitted upon Avorkarth's tile system. Each tile represents about
1.5 meters or -5 feet.
</p>

<img src="../images/rulebook/rulebook-attributes1-img1.png">

<p>
A medium creature such as a human takes up 1 tile, being approximately 1.5 meters tall. A large creature such as an ogre
takes up 4 tiles (2x2).
</p>

<h3>SIZE CATEGORIES</h3>
<p>
A creature's placement upon the field is based upon their approximate size as
noted above. These categories offer different bonuses and penalties.
</p>

<h2> PLACING</h2>

<h3>SIZE SHAPES</h3>
<p>
While size dictates the overall space that a creature takes, not all large
creatures are shaped the same way. As such a large creature does necessarily
have to be 2x2 or 3x3 tiles. As long as the number of occupied tiles are between
4 and 15, it'd be considered a large creatue, as seen below.
</p>

<p class="caption">
Hectrea are deadly large creatures (2x3), their long tusked face
allowing allowing them to charge their prey head on.
</p>

<h3>LONG SHAPES</h3>
<p>
Some creatures, such as snakes, sirens or lillends have a long tail section.
Their sections are shown as separate tokens which must be connected up to the
first body/head token. Each square chosen counts as a tail section.
</p>

<img src="../images/rulebook/rulebook-attributes2-img2.png" >}}
<p class="caption">
Thresher sirens are fierce predators while underwater or within the air,
but their long finned tail meant for swimming makes them quite vulnerable
while grounded.
</p>

<h3>POSITIONING (FRONT/FLANK/REAR)</h3>
<p>
Most creatures can only face a single direction at a time. This is their front,
which allows for them to fully use their dodge defense. If they are attacked
from the sides, that would be the flank, which gives penalties and at worse,
they are attacked from the back. For creatures with a tail, attacking any part
of the tail is counted as attacking their back.
</p>

<p class="caption">
A creature's front is always dictated by the direction of the token.
</p>

<h2>VISION</h2>
<p>
Vision, or sight, is a character's ability to see properly depending on the
amount of light that is currently available.
</p>

<h3>LIGHT CATEGORIES</h3>
<p>
The amount of light can truly vary between areas however is simplified and
categorized as follows.
</p>

<p>
<b>Daylight</b> : Typical vision in daylight can go for miles on end and is only
interrupted by line of sight, or is limited if a creature is light sensitive.
</p>

<p>
<b>Partial Light</b> : While under a moonlit night or carrying only a simple candle,
many creatures are limited in their vision. Normal vision based creatures have a
hard time seeing far under circumstances of partial light.
</p>

<p>
<b>Darkness</b> : Vision fails completely while in complete darkness, most often
while delving in depths of ancient cave systems or wandering in underground
adventures. When there is no light, characters with normal vision are considered
blind, taking even greater penalties.
</p>

<h3>Vision PENALTIES</h3>
<p>
When a character's vision is not fully compatible with the amount of light
available, they take certain penalties.
</p>

<p>
<b>Blurred</b> : The least harmful penalty, blurred vision makes the character
take -1 to all values of physical actions per distance threshold, including
combat and skill checks up to -5.
</p>

<p>
<b>Strained</b> : Should a character only be able to see general shapes, they
take -2 to all values of physical actions per distance threshold up to -10.
</p>

<p>
<b>Blind</b> : If a character is blind, they must rely on their other senses.
Whenever a blind character wishes to do a physical action, they must first
roll a die to see if they are even facing the right way.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>On a 1-4 the action critically fails.</li>
    <li>On a 5 the action fails automatically.</li>
    <li>On a roll of 6, the original action may be rolled although with -10 to the
        value and -1 to the die's result.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LIFTING CAPACITY</h2>
<p>
Upon journeys and adventures, characters are often burdened with travelling gear,
treasures or strange items of various usefulness. However, characters can only
lift so much, their strength determining their maximal weight allowance,
including the gear currently worn.
</p>

<h3>LIFTING CAPACITY</h3>
<p>
Lifting capacity determines the total amount of objects upon the character
and when they suffer penalties for carrying too much. These are separated into
multiple general categories and increased by the character's strength.
However, no matter a character's strength, their carrying amount is unfortunately still
limited by their size. A character may only carry so many items of certain sizes.
Note that worn armour and clothing does NOT count towards this capacity,
but worn items such as swords and backpacks do.
</p>

<h3>CARRY WEIGHT CATEGORIES/PENALTIES</h3>

<p>
<b>Light Load or lower</b> : A character below their light load is carrying a
comfortable amount of things and there are no penalties associated to it.
A character that can fly must be in their Light Load to fly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Light to Medium Load</b> : A character within their light load finds themselves
a bit limited in their agile based movements. | - 1 to all Dodge, Movement and
Agility based actions and skills.
</p>

<p>
<b>Medium to Heavy Load</b> : A character within their medium load finds themselves
quite limited in their agile movements. | Halve all Dodge, Movement and Agility
based actions and skills.
</p>

<p>
<b>Heavy to Maximum Load</b> : A character within their heavy load is carrying too
much to move properly and is heavily burdened. | Dodge and Movement are reduced
to 1, can only use non-movement based actions and skills. | Reduce actions per
turn to 1.
</p>

<p>
<b>Maximum Lift</b> : The final state of lifting capacity is what the character can
barely lift, but not carry with them. | Cannot move or take any action.
</p>

treasures of much greater value to be found.” - The Chronicler
</p>

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>LIFTING CAPACITY</h3>
<p>
To know what are the limits to the character's carrying capacities one must
look at one's own strength and size category.
</p>
<p>
ITEM SIZE/CARRY AMOUNT
</p>
<table style="table-layout:auto;">
	<tr><th>SIZE</th>    <th>NO LOAD</th><th>LIGHT</th><th>MEDIUM</th><th>HEAVY</th><th>MAXIMUM</th></tr>
	<tr><td>TINY</td>	 <td>9      </td><td>18   </td><td>27    </td><td>54   </td><td>162    </td></tr>
	<tr><td>SMALL</td>   <td>3      </td><td>6    </td><td>9     </td><td>18   </td><td>54     </td></tr>
	<tr><td>STANDARD</td><td>1      </td><td>2    </td><td>3     </td><td>6    </td><td>9      </td></tr>
	<tr><td>LARGE</td>   <td>-      </td><td>-    </td><td>1     </td><td>2    </td><td>3      </td></tr>
	<tr><td>MASSIVE</td> <td>-      </td><td>-    </td><td>-     </td><td>-    </td><td>1      </td></tr>
</table>

<h3>ALL THINGS RELATIVE</h3>
<p>Items sizes are relative to the character size. What is a standard longsword for a human
is a large item for a falgrii. Item size categories increase by 1 per the 
character's relative size difference.

<h3>STRENGTH BONUS</h3>
<p>A character's strength also increases the amount of items allowed held. This is 
increased at 1 tiny item more per strength. Therefore, 1 small item per 3 strength,
1 standard item per 9 strength, 1 large item per 18 strength and 1 massive item 
per 54 strength.

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h2>LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>
Most civilized cultures throughout the realm of creation have eventually created
their own specialized forms of audible communication. These languages are often
complex vocalizations unique to their species, although this does not mean one
of a different species cannot learn them.
</p>

<h3>STARTING LANGUAGES</h3>
<p>
Each species in the lorebook has their own starting languages. These are given
freely upon character creation and do not require any language points to learn.
</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES</h3>
<p>
Should a character wish to learn additional languages over the ones they begin
with, they may do so between campaigns or at character creation. (It takes time
to learn a language.)
</p>

<h3>LANGUAGE LEVELS</h3>
<p>
The common link between all languages is the progression of learning.
Each language has a few states, or levels, of complexity and are as follows.
</p>

<p>
<b>(1) Understand</b> : The character understands the essentials of what others say,
but cannot speak the language themself.
</p>

<p>
<b>(2) Speak</b> : The character can speak simple sentences and can make themselves
understood, although without any complex thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<b>(3) Read/write simple</b> : The character can speak the language perfectly,
but hasn't quite grasped the writing. The writing and reading is mostly phonetic.
</p>

<p>
<b>(4) Read/write complex</b> : The character can write, read and speak the
language perfectly.
</p>

<p>
<h3>COMPLEXITY/RARITY</h3>
<p>
The rarer a language, the harder it is to find a teacher, and the more complex
a language, the greater the understanding of basic rules is required. This is
reflected in how many language points are required to learn the language.
</p>

<p>
While each language's complexity is specific to itself, the rarity of said
languages are categorized. The languge cost increases significantly per category
and are as follows :
</p>

<p>
<b>Common</b> : Common languages are spoken throughout the midlands and are used
everyday by most common species.
</p>

<p>
<b>Odd</b> : Odd languages are still heard throughout the midlands,
although not nearly as often, usually getting a strange look from others.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rare</b> : Rare languages are heard infrequently unless in certain specific
areas of the midlands due to their rarity.
</p>

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<p>
<b>Fabled</b> : Fabled languages are, as is implied, often associated with fables
of old and many don't even believe that these languages exist.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mythical</b> : There are only a few mythical langauges, and these carry power
in each and every word. Mythical languages cannot be learned without magical
aptitude.
</p>

<h3>LEARNING LANGUAGES/LANGUAGE POINTS</h3>
<p>
The amount of language points a character has is dependant on three aspects;
the character's intelligence, the character's mastery and the character's
backstory. (See the Mastery section).
</p>

<p>
<b>Mastery</b> : Characters may spend their mastery on language points.
This is the main way to gain language points, and it is modified by the
character's intelligence.
</p>

<p>
<b>Intelligence</b> : Characters of greater intelligence have an easier time
grasping languages over their years. For each point of intelligence,
reduce the years required for a mastery point by i per intelligence point,
to a minimum of 1 per point.
</p>

<p>
<b>Backstory (Optional)</b> : If a character requires a language to match their
backstory, but doesn't have the intelligence or age to match it, they may ask
the Game Master if it's ok. Keep in mind that an overloaded character isn't
always fun for other players.
</p>

The further back you go, the more lyrical they seem to be. Quite
intriguing, wouldn't you say?" - Langdar the Sorcerer

<h3>RENOWN - (OPTIONAL)</h3>
<p>
Renown is a passive attribute meant as a method for the Game Master to track how
certain creatures or other non-playalbe characters would react to the players.
Renown is usually linked to factions, races and species, although if a Game Master
wishes, or for simpler short campigns, they can simply reduce it to a per species basis.
</p>

<h3>REPUTATION</h3>
<p>
Reputation is simply put as how well your character is valued. This doesn't
affect how well known your character is, it only tells how others of a species,
race or faction will react upon seeing your character. Note that reputation can
be split from the specific to the overall, and that is where fame helps out.
</p>

<h3>FAME</h3>
<p>
Fame shows how well a character is known within the realm of Avokrarth, be they
famous or infamous. The greater the fame, the more likely the character is to be
recognized, even if it's only for the city guards to quickly try to lock them up.
</p>

<p>
For example, a harpy character can be well liked by a human village they helped
save from a maurauding orc band, but they would still be quickly hunted or chased
out by humans of another area who know not of their heroic act.
</p>

<p class="caption">
“Bonus Text!”
</p>

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>REPUTATION LISTS</h3>
<p>
These are the list of reputations for the given campaign, be it a person or a
faction. It is the Game Master's duty to create a reputation list for the campaign
they create, and to let players know of them as they are encountered. Note that
all species in the rulebook have a general reputation list to give players a good
idea of race relations.
</p>


<h3>SPECIFIC VS. SPECIES REPUTATION</h3>
<p>
While individuals can be influenced and learn to trust or even admire those not
of their own kind, the overall special reputations never change. This is due to
it being an average and reasonable guess of how memebers of that species will
react in response of meeting another.
</p>

<p>
Compare this with a character's reputation with a guild or a particular caste,
where the members would be told of the character, including their appearance
and past actions. This would make them either more reasonable or aggressive,
depending on the character's reputation and fame.
</p>

<h3>RENOWN TITLES</h3>
<p>
Together, fame and reputation gives a title of sorts for each faction one
encounters, telling how they would react to the character. While reputation
dictates the direction of the chart (kindness at positive numbers and suspicion
for negative numbers), fame dictates the distance from neutral and actual number.
