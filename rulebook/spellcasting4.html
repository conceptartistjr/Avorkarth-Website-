<h3>REGAINING RESERVES</h3>
<p>
Should a caster require to renew their reserve of power, they need to wait a
certain amount of time or do certain actions based upon their casting type.
Reservers do not replendish while focusing, channeling or casting a ritual.

<h4>DEVOTION CASTERS
<p>
<b>Prayer</b> : Devotion casters may sit in uniterrupted prayer to their deity,
regaining 1/10th (min. 1) reserve per every 8 hours.

<p>
<b>Icon of Worship</b> : The caster further reduces the renewal interval by 4 hours.

<p>
<b>Area of Sanctity</b> : If the caster is in an area of might from their deity,
halve the time required after the calculations of prayer and icon of worhip.

<h4>ARCANE CASTERS</h4>
<p>
<b>Ley Attunement</b> : Arcane casters regain 1/10th (min 1.) of their reserve per
6 hours naturally.

<p>
<b>Syphon</b> : Arcane casters may touch any magical object to absorbe its power.
They regain reserve equal to the level of the spell cast upon the item.
The item loses all magical qualities until the same amount of energy is
refocused upon it. However, should the level of the spell on the item
surpass the caster's spellcasting level, they additionally take 3 lethal damage
per spell level higher.

<h4>SPIRIT CASTERS</h4>
<p>
<b>Nature Bound</b> : Spirit casters are bound to the health of the land.
They regain 1/10th (min 1.) of their reserve per X amount of time,
slowing significantly in areas without spiritual life.

<h2>CASTING SPELLS</h2>
<p>
Whenever a spellcaster wishes to use magic in any form, they must weave their
inner power and the mana flowing through the world into a tangible reserve.
This is known as the art of spellcasting. While dependant per the power and
ability of the caster, magic always requires three components to be calculated.
The chosen spell, the caster's own might and the spent amount of time.
</p>

<h3>CASTING TIME</h3>
<p>
To all spellcasters, time is one the most essential components to casting spells,
as the longer one has to concentrate on a spell, the less it costs upon their
mind and body, essentially raising or lowering the caster's spellcaster level.
Casting time is based upon how many actions, rounds or amount of time is required.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rituals</b> : A spellcaster can at best focus upon a spell at 3 spell caster
levels higher than their own. Should a spell take longer than an hour,
it is instead considered as a ritual.
</p>

<h4>SPELLCASTING TIME/SPELLCASTER LEVEL</h4>

<table>
<tr><th> Action Time             </th><th> Caster Level </th></tr>
<tr><td> Immediate/Swift Action  </td><td>   -2         </td></tr>
<tr><td> Standard Action         </td><td>   -1         </td></tr>
<tr><td> Full Round Action       </td><td>   -          </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1 Minute (10 Rounds)    </td><td>   +1         </td></tr>
<tr><td> 10 Minutes (100 Rounds) </td><td>   +2         </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1+ Hour (600 Rounds)    </td><td>   Ritual     </td></tr>

Lesser fae-folk, such as pixies and gnomes, often live or die based upon the
health of the land. It is why many superstitious humans fear the woods and often
keep the land at the edge of their farms barren.
