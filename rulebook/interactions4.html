<h1>INTERACTIONS</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">


<h2>SKILLS</h2>
<p>
Skills are predetermined actions that the character may do, although which
require a certain amount of expertise. Unlike actions, there is a chance that
the character's ability to perform these skills isn't good enough and that the
character fails their attempt.
</p>

<h3>USING SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Skills function exactly as actions, with a certain amount of time allocated per
skill. The difference lies in the chance of failure. Unlike an action which is
simply declared, a skill must also be rolled. The roll is then checked against
the difficuly check and the outcome decided.
</p>

<h3>DIFFICULTY CHECKS (DCs)</h3>
<p>
As with all dice rolls, to know if a skill was succesful, it must be rolled
against a difficulty check. These are preset numbers that the skill value of
the roll is used against. (See Dice Rolls)
</p>

<h3>MULTIPLE ABILITY SCORES</h3>
<p>
Should a skill benefit from multiple ability scores, the character chooses
only one. These bonuses do not stack, and only the chosen ability score is used
for the skill roll.
</p>

<h3>SKILL TYPES - NATURAL SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Natural skills are ones that relies more upon the character's natural inborn
abilities. These skills aren't as heavily penalized for being untrained but
don't get as much from mastery.
</p>

<p>
NATURAL SKILL VALUE Relevant Ability Score + Mastery Bonus - 2
</p>

<h3>SKILL TYPES - LEARNED SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Learned skills can also be attempted by any character (as long as they aren't
complex), although without learning the intricacies the characterwill have a
much tougher task ahead. Learned skills have a much heavier penalty untrained
and relies upon mastery.
</p>

<p>
LEARNED SKILL VALUE Relevant Ability Score + Mastery Bonus - 5
</p>

<h3>SKILL TYPES - TRADE SKILLS</h3>
Trade skills are very similar to learned skills, however are always complex and
can only be used if they have a mastery point within.
</p>

<p>
TRADE SKILL VALUE Relevant Ability Score + Mastery Bonus - 3
</p>

</div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>SKILL TYPES - KNOWLEDGE SKILLS</h3>
<p>
While knowledge skills are much like learned skills for their penalty and mastery,
they also further penalties depending on the character's upbringing, backstory
and other knowledges.
</p>

<p>
KNOWLEDGE SKILL VALUE Relevant Ability Score + Mastery Bonus - 5
</p>

<p>
<b>Knowledge - World</b> : Knowledge skills are split into two categories and any
point put into said race or region category allows the character to roll for any
minor category included. These minor categories can also be further mastered.
Characters start with their own race and region of growth automatically
</p>

<p>
<b>Knowledge - Magic</b> : Knowledge Magic is split into 5 major categories, or
spheres of magic, each with specific sub-spheres. Having knowledge of magic
does not give a character magical abilities, but can be used for knowing or
using magical items.
</p>

<h3>COMPLEX SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Any skill marked as Complex are too intricate for lesser minds. A complex skill
requires that the character be of intelligence 3 or more.
</p>

<h3>LIMITED SKILLS</h3>
<p>
Skills marked as limited aren't able to be nearly as enhanced and gain much less
from any mastery. If so marked, limited skills reduce any mastery bonus by half,
rounded down.
