<h1>SPELLCASTING</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>SPELLCASTING RARITY</h3>
<p>
Magic is truly rare within Avorkarth and most of its mortal races live their
entire lives without its presence, especially the most common, humanity.
The magical and supernatural are hidden away and even beneficial magic is
looked upon with fear and distrust. Only answered prayers that come from
some divine calling or a miracle from the light based gods of one's own race
is viewed with grace and kindness.
</p>

<p>
Should a character have any spellcasting abilities, or has magical powers due
to racial benefits, they would best be weary of using such things around the
commonfolk, for most do not react well to it.
</p>

<h3>SPELL SPHERES</h3>
<p>
While casting spells is split into three distinct styles, the spheres of magic
and their sub-sections, such as Fire, Necromantic or Daemonic to list a few,
are the actual realms from which casters draw their powers. Elemental magic,
as an example, is shared between Arcane and Spiritual casters, the former
controlling it and the latter borrowing it, but both Arcane and Spirit casters
are able to cast from its Sphere with varying effects.
</p>

<h3>SPELLCASTING TYPES</h3>
<p>
Magic at its core is split into three types, Devotion, Arcane and Spirit.
</p>

<h4>DIVINE/DEVOTION - PRAYERS AND LITANITES -</h4>
<p>
While still rare, devotion spells are the most often seen by common folk.
Devotion spells are viewed as miracles or divine intervention and rightly so,
as it is powers gifted and granted by divine or ancient beings. Divine spells are
incantations, prayers or callings upon the worshipper's deity. Through the proper
words, the belief of the caster, their fervor to the deity being called and the
intervention of the deity itself, devotion spells are able to be cast.
It is used by priests, worshippers and enforcers of certain deities or mighty beings.
</p>

<p>
<b>Given Power</b> : Devotion casters have access to all the spells given by their
deity, as long as they have enough mana. These can be called upon and cast at
any time unless specified. Each deity has a list of spells under their names
in the Lore section.
</p>

<p>
<b>Deity's Chosen</b> : Devotion casters also gain bonuses given by their primary
deity. These are listed before the spell list.
</p>

<p>
<b>Place of Worship</b> : If a devotion caster is within a sanctified area of their
deity, they increase their caster might by 1 for spell costs and effects.
</p>

<h4>ARCANE/LEY-LINE - INCANTATIONS AND SPELLS -</h4>
<p>
The mystical arts of sorcery and wizardry are ones shrouded in mystery and
superstition, yet is one of powers beyond imagining. Arcane spells are similarily
cast as devotions through incantation, yet only function as an infusion of the
caster's magical attunement alongside their knowledge of the spell itself.
To gain such attunement to the arcane, practitioners will usually study ancient
texts and tomes, have a well of power already within them, or find a darker path
through bargains with ancient powers. Arcane magic derives from the laws of the
world and is used by wizards, necromancers, sorcerers and other traditional casters.
</p>

<p>
<b>Spell Memorization</b> : Creatures who study the arcane can memorize a certain
number of spells equal to their intelligence score.
</p>

<p>
<b>Arcane Tome</b> : Arcane casters must write down all of their magical
incantations and spells that they've discovered. This tome allows arcane
casters to spend a single action to find any non-memorized spell they have
since learnt and cast it during their next action. Any newly encounted arcane
spell can be studied and added to the tome. Studying a new spell takes
exponentially more time the greater the spell's level.
</p>

<p>
<b>Changing Memorized Spells</b> : Arcane casters may rememorize different spells
by spending about half a day (12 hours) reading their tome.
</p>

<h4>SPIRIT/NATURAL - UNBOUND POWER -</h4>
<p>
The elusive and nearly invisible power that creates life itsellf is known to
very few and detectable by even fewer. This power that has been within all things
since the creation of the Realm is most present and powerful within lands of
unbound growth. It is the basis of all magic, appearing as an echo to the first
ages' songs. Spirit magic appears within areas of the world where magic is
respected and a more primal view is upheld. For this reason, it has been
disappearing, its subtle flow ignored by the fast paced lives of most younger
mortal races, and dissipating due to areas of populated civilization and reckless
construction. It is mostly only used by fae-folk and eldritch creatures.
</p>

<p>
<b>Inner Power</b> : Creatures attuned to Spiritual magic may cast any spell from
within their sphere of magic without restriction. Spiritual casting is similar
to a whim or a feeling instead of a precise incantation, often appearing as a
series of harmonzing notes or as a beautiful or terrifying song.
