<h1>ALIGNMENTS</h1>
<p>
For every heart of good, there resides one of hatred. For every servant of chaos,
there is a servant of law. The realm of Avorkarth's inhabitants are many and
varied, though all act accordingly, although loosely, to an alignment rule system.
Such is the same for any created character. Alignments are the basis of a character's
response and reaction to an event, and how it would affect them. A law abiding
character seeing a crime commited in front of them may try to stop it or inform
the local guards, while a more chaotic character may chuckle and simply watch to
see where the whole affair will go.
</p>

<p>
Not all species are capable of any alignment, as that is a gift, or a
curse, that is mostly held by humanity. Many species in the lore book have
limitations due to their creators, gods and other influences throughout the ages.
Remember, only a human acts as a human.

<h1>ALIGNMENTS</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h2>ALIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS</h2>

<h3>NEUTRAL - “SURVIVOR”</h3>
<p>
Neutral characters only seek to continue living and are the most common type of
character. They do not care that their actions fall between good or evil,
law or chaos, as long as they do not go hungry or thirsty. Should a conflict
occur, neutral characters would seek the side that aids them the most.
</p>

<h3>TRUE NEUTRAL - “SEEKER”</h3>
<p>
True Neutral characters seek the truth behind all things, be it in the balance of
the mind and heart, the mysteries of the arcane or the secrets of life and death.
They are the seekers, who do not judge but simply listen and learn. They are
much rarer than the traditional Neutral characters.
</p>

<h3>NEUTRAL GOOD - “CHAMPION”</h3>
<p>
Neutral good characters seek to bring good and well-being wherever they travel.
They treat others well, counsel and aid those in need and will go out of their
way to do the right thing, as long as this does not bring harm to those close
to them or that which they consider good. In times of darkness, Neutral Good characters
will defend those who follow their path, but are not entirely vindictive to
those willing to repent, letting live those who have done evil as
long as they are punished accordingly.
</p>

<h3>NEUTRAL EVIL - “VILLAIN”</h3>
<p>
Neutral Evil characters are those willing to do evil to further their own agenda.
They seek to better their standing in life and are ready to harm others
should it aid them in achieving this goal. Neutral Evil characters are quick to
bargain and to scheme in the event of tragedy, seeking to aid themselves before
anyone else can capitalize on the happenings. Characters of this alignment have
no problem with evil acts as long as they gain something out of it, but will not
gain extreme pleasure nor remorse from the action.
</p>

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>LAWFUL NEUTRAL - “JUDGE"</h3>
<p>
Lawful Neutral characters are those not easily swayed to good or evil and instead
act upon an iron moral code. They will listen to all information available
before making their decision, however this decision will also be swayed
by their code's stance, be it religous or cultural. They usually do not act rashly,
but are surprisingly stubborn once their decision is made, unless additional
information comes to light.
</p>

<h3>CHAOTIC NEUTRAL - “WHIMSICAL”</h3>
<p>
Chaotic Neutral characters do whatever they wish to, whenever it comes to them and
without regard to the end destination or reward. Chaotic Neutral characters may
seem to distrust authority, but it is more truthful to say that these characters
are simply spontaneous and are given to a wider range of quick-minded thoughts
which drift to individuality and freedom. Should a tragedy occur,
these characters will often give their skills to use, though as to why, none but
the character can really say. Chaotic Neutral characters tend to be questioning,
curious and whimsical, and with a dislike or rules and restrictions.
</p>

<h3>LAWFUL GOOD - “CRUSADER"</h3>
<p>
Lawful Good characters follow a given ruleset, be it divine scripture or a
personal code, that tells of virtues. These characters are set in their ways of
good and will always aid those that are within their care, no matter the cost.
They stand before darkness and evil always, their rules guiding their every action.
This also makes them hard to reason with and a Lawful Good character
will carry out their duty against wrong-doers or creatures their code views as
evil, their forgiveness very hard to gain.

<h1> ALIGNMENTS</h1>

<div class="bookpage-columns">
    <div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>LAWFUL EVIL - “DOMINATOR”</h3>
<p>
Lawful Evil characters are bound to the nature of power. The strong dominates
the weak, and the truly strong need not break their own ruleset to achieve such
power. Tradition and loyalty are of great value to Lawful Evil characters,
yet they do not understand mercy or kindness for they view those as weaknesses
to exploit.
Lawful Evil characters understand that rulesets aid in keeping the structure of
their might intact, but aren't beyond massacering what is necessary and will
easily take pleasure in the pain of others when it gains them more power or shows
their dominance.
</p>

<h3>CHAOTIC GOOD - “RENEGADE”</h3>
<p>
Chaotic Good characters are individualistic beings above all. They view the
idea of having strict rules as wrong as their beliefs often tell them that not everything
is cut and dry. These characters will often carry out actions for what they believe is
the greater good, even should it bypass the laws in place and may be of benefit
only in the moment of things. Though the hearts of chaotic good characters are
kind and loving, they do not always agree with the larger picture or with the
set rules if it harms or is unfair to another of their kind. Nonetheless,
they would stand side by side even with Lawful Good characters against those of
evil intent.
</p>

<h3>CHAOTIC EVIL - “MANIAC"</h3>
<p>
Chaotic Evil characters do whatever is upon their mind, as long as it brings
them pleasure or satisfaction. Unpredictable, 
Chaotic Evil characters are prone to simply be
evil for the sake of being evil, without the need for a reward.
These characters adore breaking rules and causing mayhem wherever they go and
will do so at every turn, even turning on those who were allies mere moments
ago. As such, these characters' schemes often do not last long as they so
easily turn upon themselves.
</p>

<h3>TRUE GOOD - “FORGIVER”</h3>
<p>
True Good characters are often viewed as naive, for they are characters that
will always seek the good in every encounter. These characters will go out of
their way to aid everyone and everything on both sides of an argument, attempting
even to bring those of darkest hearts to light. Characters of True Good following
will often lend a hand to anyone if simply asked or if they see that something
is wrong, even often bringing pain upon themselves if it means helping another.
They are easily tricked by evil characters, but sometimes their absolute kindness
and gentleness softens and redeems those of dark intent or turns the most hardened
lawful character into one willing to stand with an enemy to face a greater threat.
</p>

    </div><div class="bookpage-column">

<h3>TRUE EVIL - “DESTROYER”</h3>
<p>
True Evil characters are exactly as their given title describes them.
They seek pure destruction in all of its forms and have few other impulses or
goals that drive their actions. Their purpose is single-minded, and that is to
bring their own flaming vision of the world with no regard to anything or anyone
else. Such characters are very far and few between, and while many would think
that these characters are foolishly straight-forward, only their goal is as such
and many True Evil characters can be very manipulative in furthering their
cause against life itself.
</p>

<h3>TRUE LAWFUL - “ZEALOT”</h3>
<p>
True Lawful characters are beings bound to the laws given to them. They follow
this rulest methodically and will never sway from it, no matter the situation.
As such, a True Lawful character is hard to associate with since they will not
forgive even a single deviation from their code and will harsly deal out justice
to any who would defy or cross the will of the code or being they serve.
</p>

<h3>TRUE CHAOTIC - “FANATIC”</h3>
<p>
True Chaotic characters have abandonned reason, no longer abiding to laws or
rules of any sort except their own. They are much like True Evil characters
in which they would erase all things living, yet would not replace it with
their own vision as they have none. Characters that are of this alignment are
usually corrupted or taken over by a spell of madness. The few characters who
are True Chaotic by nature tend to be followers of deities of insanity and
pandemonium, heading cults whose goal is to simply erase exsistance itself.
