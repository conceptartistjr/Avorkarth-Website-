## WILL STATE
A character's will is ever important, giving them the courage to stand up
against their foes or the heart to resist the most dangerous of temptations.
However, even the most hardened veterans may fall to the terrors or charms of
battle and spells.

**Charm/Fear Points** : Whenever an effect says that the character gains a charm
or fear point, they must refer to the fright and/or charm charts to see if any
effect is yet placed on the character.

**Charmed and Feared** : Should a character be suffering a charm and fear effect
at the same time, they must suffer the effect of whichever is greater at the
moment. If they are tied, fear is the greater effect.

**Regaining Sanity** : Characters lose 1 fear and charm point per safe night's rest.

humans as Nymphs. Their graceful allure is used to its full advantage when
hunting any who would trespass their lakes, rivers and forests uninvited.” - The Chronicler
