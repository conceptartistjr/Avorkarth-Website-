<h3> PREMADE CHARACTER SHEETS </h3>

<p><i>These premade characters were created by the very first testers to finish a full avorkarth
campaign. Their characters shall be always remembered. (Their sheets are currently being
remade with the few changes I did since they played.)</i></p>

<h3> Istmun Dain </h3>
<table>
<tr><td style="width:25%;"><img src="images/general/Istmun.jpg"></td>
<td style="vertical-align:top;"><br>A sharassian scholar and follower of the word of Hektah, keeper of knowledge, Istmun has
long poured through the many tomes and volumes of the many libraries of his god. Naturally curious, Istmun
had found himself often in studies for nights on end, barely sustaining himself. It was only so long before
he had exhausted all that he could learn from the written word of his city. So it was that he travelled the 
dunes, stopping within any establishment and quietly asking of the local myths and mysteries. Still
this was not enough and Istmun decided that the true knowledge that Hektah wished for him to find
would not be simply in one land, but in all of them. Istmun shrugged, nodded to himself and adjusted
his journey to follow northern stars, determined to learn next what was the knowledge kept by
the lighter skinned Karthians.

<h3 style="text-align:right"> Mable of Kordarr </h3>
<table>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><br>Mable and her husband Sam were a pair of ordinary karthian crafstmen living within
the kingdom of Kordarr. They sold their merchandise well and lived a comfortable life,
kind and gentle souls both.
They may have exagerrated a thing here or there, but what great merchant doesn't play
up their products?  So it was, until Sam passed away of old age. Mable grieved, but found that she
felt at her best when continuing their work. "Shouldn't you retire?", others said. Mable
would nod with a smile, but keep on working. One day, she simply packed up her most 
precious belongings and journeyed out into the realm to see what she could do to keep busy 
in her last years of life, and what souls she would be able to share tales with.

<h3> Sarless Equinta</h3>
<table>
<tr><td style="width:25%"><img src="images/general/Sarless.jpg"></td>
<td style="vertical-align:top;"><br>The son of escaped Tildran slaves, Sarless was raised almost entirely in the wilderness.
Fearing for retribution and the penalty of death awaiting escaped slaves, his parents refused to return to civilization,
trying their best to head west towards the remaining free Tildran tribes. Unfortunately,
their ill health took hold of their lives and they passed when Sarless was naught but a 
young man. Since then, Sarless has kept practicing what little his father taught him
of keeping himself alive through the hunt. Yet
living in woodlands is no easy task and both curiosity and the fatigue of the wilds
were beginning to get the better of him. Perhaps it was time for a journey outside the 
woods and to return to the few memories he had of civilization.

<h3 style="text-align:right"> Velarae Dewblossom</h3>
<table>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;"><br>The proud daughter of the Sanguinnar nation, Velarae is devoted to the Eternal King
and his eventual return. Showing great promise in her youth, she was 
brought into the house of Sinathen, those of her kind that 
roam the realm outside the golden glades as the hidden eyes, ears and if need be, blade of the Sanguinnar.
Due to the ignorance of humans of aelven variations, she learnt to emulate
the Narei, and will answer as one of their kind, although the pride and arrogance
over lesser races of the sanguinnar are wont to appear should she be in a foul mood. 
She hides beneath cloak and hood always and has changed her name many times over the decades, as well as her 
appearance, but she always remains true to her singular mission.

<h3> Youldyr Rabbansson </h3>
<table>
<tr><td style="width:25%"><img src="images/general/Youldyr.jpg"></td>
<td style="vertical-align:top;"><br>According to Youl, as he calls himself, Youldyr is the greatest hero and warrior that his clan has
ever produced. In truth, Youldyr does indeed have a great warrior's strength and stamina,
but as he would learn, too tender a heart.
Once, when hunting alongside his elder sister
and a few clanmates, they were waylaid by karthian bandits. Youl was proud, for he had saved his friend's arm
as well as having fought off a single bandit. Grinning, as the hero he was, he turned
only to see his sister in a berserker's rage finishing off her eigth bandit in a bloody rampage. For some reason,
his heart sunk at the sight. He was told by his clan
that he was better suited to be a tenderer, a caregiver or crafstman given his gentle nature.
"Bah", he said to the elders! "Fah!", he cried out to his father! He said nothing to his nana, because
she was lovely and he couldn't bring himself to insult her. Still he craved the hero's worship his sister
had, and so he snuck out in the night, stealing one of his father's swords to adventure onwards and
prove his overwhelming manliness!
