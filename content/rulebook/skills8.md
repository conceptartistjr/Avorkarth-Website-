## KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
Knowledge skills are much like the trade skills in that they all share the same
difficulty check. Unlike trade skills however, knowledge skills don't have a
choice for their difficulty check and instead function like normal skills in
that the knowledge in question is the difficulty check.

Knowledge skills can overlap as well, and any creature may roll all the knowledge
skills they think will give information and are not limited to rolling a single
knowledge skill per query. Each knowledge facet will give different answers.

### KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
Checks : Once per knowledge.
Difficulty Check/Bonus : Per query.
Armour Penalty : None.
Combat Uses : None.
Additional : See below.
Critical Success : The knowledge is well known to the creature.
  Gain an additional piece of information for free.
Success : The queried knowledge is satisfied and known.
Partial Success : The knowledge is somewhat known, but the answer known is
  vague at best.
Fail : The knowledge is unknown.
Critical Fail : The character thinks the answer is something that
  is not even relevant.

### SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE - REGION 
**Very Similar** : Creatures may attempt Knowledge : Region checks for sub-skills
a similar aspect, such as a Knowledge : Nature check for a different region of
desert, although with a -2 penalty

**Somewhat Similar** : Knowledge skills that share a bit of a similar aspect,
like a river to a lake, take a -4 penalty.

**Barely Similar** : Knowledge skills that are too different but still in the
same sphere, such as knowledge of deserts versus knowledge of forests
take a -7 penalty.

### SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE - RACE
Same sub-race : Creatures may attempt Knowledge : Race checks for unknown races
of the same species (human variation against another human variation), although
with a -2 penalty

**Known species** : If the species are known to one another but not of the same
species (humans and aelvenkin), the penalty is instead -4.

**Conflicted species** : If the races are known to one another but not in good
standing (humans and goblinkin), the penalty is dropped to -7.

**Unknown/Mythical species** : If the species barely know or are unknown to one
another (humans and faefolk), the penalty is -10.

### SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE - MAGIC
**Different Sphere** : Creatures may attempt Knowledge : Magic checks for
spheres other than their own, although with a -5 penalty.
