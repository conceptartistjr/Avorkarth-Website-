# COMBAT

{{< snippet >}}<div class="bookpage-columns"><div class="bookpage-column">{{< /snippet >}}

From the clash of steel upon the battlefield, to duels within a gladitorial arena,
to a heroic warrior battling a drake upon a snowed mountain, combat within
Avorkarth may happen wherever the adventurer goes. Combat is replicated in
avorkarth using a turn based system and begins when the Game Master declares so,
usually upon the request of a player or an ambush from deadly creatures.

## INITIATING/ENACTING COMBAT

#### COMBAT ORDER

##### A. - IF AMBUSHED
(If not, go to B.)
* All creatures roll 1d6 and add their initiative, with ambushing creatures
  adding an additional +10 to their total.
* Order all the initiatives in a list, from highest to lowest.
* Any ambushed creature whose initiative is lower than the lowest ambushing
  creature does not act this round. - The highest initiative goes first.
  Players win ties. (Go to C.)

##### B. - MARK INITIATIVE
* (If finishing an Ambush round) - Any ambushing creatures lose their
  +10 initiative bonus.
* All creatures roll id6 and add their initiative
* Any creature whose agility bonus is high enough adds their additional
  turns at their initiative - 5 per additional turn.
* Order all the initiatives in a list, from highest to lowest.
* The highest initiative goes first. Players win ties. (Go to C.)

##### C. - CREATURE'S TURN
* If it is the creature's first turn in the round, they must roll their
  Resolve check.
* The acting creature regains all standard, move, swift and immediate actions
  at the start of their first turn.
* If a creature is doing a full round action and they have more than one turn,
  all turns are forgone and skipped unless they stop their full round action.
* The creature may then use the equivalent of one move and one standard action,
  or one full action. (Unless specified otherwise).
* The creature may choose to stay their actions and declare to use them another
  time, in which case their turn ends and they may re-enact their turn before
  any next creature's turn.
* If all creatures have taken their turns - Go to D.
* If not, repeat C. for the next creature in the initiative list.

##### D. - ROUND'S END
* Enact all area, environmental and over-time effects, such as burns,
  bleeds or poisons.
* Remove all creatures that have perished from the initiative list,
  and begin a new round with the updated initiative list.
* The highest initiative goes first. Players win ties. (Go to C.)

#### TURNS VS. ROUNDS
Many effects happen either every so many turns or every so many rounds.
These are used to distinguish between different time signatures as combat occurs.

**Turn** : This is when a character does their actions, and is approximation of
a character's ability to do anything within a short amount of time.

**Round** : This is only updated once every character has acted all of their
turns. The round is an approximation of 8 seconds in real-time and is the most
common time keeper for effects with most of them occuring at the end of every round.

#### ADDITIONAL TURNS AND EXTRA ACTIONS
Creatures gain 1 additional action per round for each 4 agility, with a maximum
of 1 move and 1 standard per turn. Every additional action afterwards is added
as another turn at their initiative -5.

Examples :
* Creature with 3 agility : 1 turn per round with 1 Move action.
* Creature with 5 agility : 1 turn per round with 1 Move and 1 Standard action.
* Creature with 8 agility : 2 turns, first with 1 Move and 1 Standard,
  and a second turn with 1 Move action.
* Creature with 12 agility : 2 turns, 1 with i Move and 1 Standard,
  and a second with 1 Move and 1 Standard again.

#### COMBAT ACTIONS
As noted, creatures have only a certain amount of actions they may do on a turn.

**Full Round Action** : The creature must focus and concentrate. They lose all
their turns for the round.

**Full Action** : The creature forgoes their move and standard actions for the
turn to use a full action instead. If they only have a move action for the turn,
they cannot do a Full Action.

**Standard Action (1 per turn)** : The standard action, most commonly used to
attack. Can be forgone to gain an additional move action.

**Move Action (1 per turn)** : The creature moves, climbs, swims or flies.
Can be forgone to do a swift action or lesser attack action. (See combat attacks further on.)

**Swift Action (1 + 1 per 5 agility per turn)** : A short action. Can be used
alongside a move or standard action on one's turn.

**Immediate Action (1 +1 per 4 agility per turn)**: A very short action.
Can be used in reaction to enemy or allied actions even if not one's turn.
