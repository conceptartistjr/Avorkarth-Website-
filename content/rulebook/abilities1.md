# Ability Scores

{{< snippet >}}<div class="bookpage-columns"><div class="bookpage-column">{{< /snippet >}}

Ability scores are the core representation of every creature's general aptitudes,
each notes by a flat number which in turn denotes a tier. These numbers determine
the creature's. statistics for various facets such as their might, swiftness,
bravery, balance and so on.

### Examples

### Ability Score Categories
Abilities are split into distinct categories. These are the Physical, Mind and
Social abilities, each governing a part of the character's whole. The details
for each is detailed on the further pages.

|             |                                             |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
| Physical    | Strenth, Constitution, Agility, Dexterity   |
| Mind        | Instinct, Intelligence, Willpower           |
| Social      | Wisdom, Charisma, Beauty                    |

### Ability Score Tiers
Ability score tiers are an approximation of the ablity score's power against
the average of the realm's. Each ability tier increase or decrease represents a
significant difference in the power of the ability score and grants additional
bonuses.

| Tier          | Ability Score | Bonus   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------:|
| Minor         |    1-2        |  -2     |
| Lessor        |    3-5        |  -1     |
| Standard      |    6-10       |   0     |
| Greater       |    11-15      |  +1     |
| Superior      |    16-20      |  +2     |
| Mighty        |    21-30      |  +3     |
| Legendary     |    31-40      |  +4     |
| Mythical      |     41+       |  +5     |

### Ability Score Averages
Every species (as shown in the examples) within the beastiary is assinged an
ability score in all three categories. The number shown represents the normal,
average habitant or travellor of said species. However certain individuals
within the masses are gifted, trained, or simply better or worse at parts of
their abilities. This is represented by the increase or decrease of ability
scores.

|    |               |    |               |
|:--:|:-------------:|:--:|:-------------:|
| 1  | Pixie         | 2  | House Cat     |
| 4  | Halfling      | 5  | Goblin        |
| 7  | Human         | 9  | Panther       |
| 10 | Grizzly       | 12 | Minotaur      |
| 14 | Ogre1         | 17 | Roc           |
| 18 | Hill Giant    | 29 | Treant        |
| 25 | Hydra         | 32 | Dune Wurm     |
| 33 | Xia Serpent   | 35 | Pit Fiend     |
| 37 | Dragon        | 42 | Colossus      |
| 46 | Kraken        | 50 | Elder Dragon  |

### Increasing Ability Scores
Ability scores may be increased by players when creating their characters by
choosing any number of their species' available classes. The increase is specified
on the class itself. If a player chooses multiple classes with the same ablility
score increase, they choose the greater one and don't add the benefits together.
**Keep in mind, each point in an ability score is a significant difference
of power!**

Should a player wish to gain the benefits of a class, although don't want the
ability score increase that comes along with that choice due to their backstory
or characters lore, they may ignore the ability score increase.

### Decreasing Ability Scores
If a character's backstory should dictate their ability scores be lowered, this
is entirely up to the player's choice. While it isn't recommened due to how class
feats function, there is nothing stopping the player from creating a weaker
variation of thier chosen species.

**Player Tip!:** Ultimately when choosing the character's ability scores it is
best to keep to the rulebook's numbers and to try and match the backstory of the
created character. It is even possible to play as a simple villager adventuring
for thier first time by not choosing any class and not increasing no decreasing
any ability scores. As with all things, keep in mind the other players and their
playstyles as well!
