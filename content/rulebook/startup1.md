# Start-Up

{{< snippet >}}<div class="bookpage-columns"><div class="bookpage-column">{{< /snippet >}}

Welcome to Avorkarth, a role-playing game set in a realm of low-fantasy adventure.
This rulebook will aid players in setting up a role-playing session (campaign/adventure),
based within the realm of Avorkarth. The following ruleset will give an understanding
of of the many ways the players may manipulate or interact with the world they find
themselves in.

Long time table-top players may find this game is not quite as mechanically balanced
as similar table-top games out there, with the idea of being more immersive.

Each section of the rulebook will tend to a specific set of rules that defines what
actions or choices the player's character may take. If this is the first time that
a player will enter into the realm of Avorkarth, it is highly recommended that
they read the rulebook even if they've previously played other similar table-top
role-playing games.

## Base Requirements

### Players (Recommended: 3 to 7)
The players of Avorkarth are separated into two categories.

**Game Master (GM)**: A single player takes the role of arbitrator for the current
and future sessions, known as the Game Master. Their role is to control all
non-player characters, creatures and challenges and are also in charge of creating
and/or setting the stage for the adventure that the remaining players will go through.

**Adventurers**: The remaining players each control a single character, usually of
their own creation, and are tasked with finishing and beating the goal given by
Game Master with the skills and abilities of their created character. Unlike most
table-top games, Avorkarth campaigns are usually written so as to be immersive,
and therefore are able to be beaten in many ways, not always through bloodshed
or combat.

### Area of Play
Avorkarth is based upon traditional paper and pencie role-playing games, and as
such may be fully played as along as players have access to six-sided dice or a
dice-rolling program/app and a method of jotting down information such as a
tablet or pad of paper.

While playing around a table with friends is an incredible experience, it is also
entirely possbile to play with others from around the world using online voice-chat
systems. There are even many websites and digital programs dedicated to recreating
table-top like experiences.

### 6 Sided Dice
Avorkarth uses 6 sided dice as its main playing component, with rolling dice
representing the randomality of life for most characters actions. Should a character
wish to jump, charm, sooth, tend, attack or do any other action in which the
result is not wholly predictable, they would roll the required amount of dice and
compare the results with the dice-rolling charts to know if they've succeeded.

### Adventurers - Character Sheets
Players who take on the rolw of the adventurers will create and take control of
a single character, and avator of their own will within the realm. These characters
do not necessarily represent the player themselves, but rather are a character
of their own imagination. They can have their own personality, set of skills,
strengths or weaknesses of completely unrelated note to their player.
Most information and numbers required to create a character may be found in the
Avorkarth lorebooks.
