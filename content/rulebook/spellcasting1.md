# SPELLCASTING

Upon the rarest of nights there are some that swear of hearing incantations upon
the faintest of winds and feel that the world has somehow changed. This belief of
magical and supernatural supersitions is often laughed at, mocked and belittled,
though could not be more true. Magic, though extremely rare, is very much a part
of Avorkarth. Eldritch powers and ancient spiritual beings are present within the
deep areas of the world, while servants to the many gods enact rituals to gain
favor and blessings for their kin or personal power and wizards construct arcane
studies that live long after they pass from the age.
