# INTERACTIONS

{{< snippet >}}<div class="bookpage-columns"><div class="bookpage-column">{{< /snippet >}}

A character's interaction with the world is shown by the use of actions,
or simply put, “the things they may do”. These actions are split into three
distinct categories, being the General actions, Skill actions and Combat actions.

### ACTIONS

#### ACTION TYPES
Actions are how the character interacts with the world and encompass
the following :

**General Actions** : These are actions that can be done at any time,
such as drinking a potion, reading a scroll or speaking to another.

**Skill Actions** : These are general actions that have a chance of failure.
Such actions are jumping over a cliff, acting out a play or disguising oneself.

**Combat Actions** : These actions can only be done while in combat or to
begin combat such as swinging a sword or casting an offensive spell.

#### ACTION LENGTH
Any action takes a certain amount of time and while under stressful situations
such as combat, characters are limited in the number of actions they may do in
a given time. To easily categorize all actions, there are multiple categories
of time lengths based upon turns and rounds.

If an action takes longer than a full turn's worth, it is carried over to that
character's next turn.

**Move Action** : The base Move Action is given freely to all characters,
no matter how slow their reaction speed.

**Standard Actions** : The most common action, most characters tend to have
a single Standard Action per turn alongside their Move action.

**Full Actions** : Full actions are set as a static amount of time that doesn't
change no matter how quick the character is. These ALWAYS take a full round and
the character's full attention.

**Swift Actions** : These actions are quick but still take up enough time that
they cannot be done except on the turn of the character. These actions may be
done alongside a standard or move action.

**Immediate Actions** : Immediate Actions are so impressively fast that they may
be done during another creature's turn. Immediate actions often need to be
prepared ahead of time.

#### THE TELLING ACTION
Tian watched as Uru tested her now healed sinuous tail, its fins cresting the
waters of the large pond. The lightest smile etched his face as he contemplated
her movements with his usual studious nature. It was obvious that the pond was
too small for the siren, but it didn't stop her from moving with the grace of
her oceanic predatory kind. His eyes sharpened as he caught the glimpse of her
sharpened teeth beneath the tattooed line.

Suddenly a flick of the creature's hips rippling through to the end of her tail
and a wave of droplets was flying towards him, the thresher siren giving him a
mischevious grin.

Taking a quick breath, Tian exhaled and let his martial subconcious take over.
His hand and arm became a blur as they lightly touched each droplet of water
ever so gently as to divert them to either side of his body.

Uru pouted and huffed, speaking in a broken tongue. “How were you ready for that?”

"Every action has a tell before it occurs.” replied the monk with his usual
serenity, “Yours was your smile.”
