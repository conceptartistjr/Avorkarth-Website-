# CLASS TALENTS

{{< snippet >}}<div class="bookpage-columns"><div class="bookpage-column">{{< /snippet >}}

### CLASSES | TALENTS
Unlike many table-top games, a player is not locked in a class of a specific
choice in the realm of Avorkarth. Instead, the player may pick and choose from
the list of talents available to their race to create their own class,
matching as closely as possible to their backstory. Want a thief who is good at
sword fighting? No problem, that can be done. What about a shamanistic barbarian?
Take talents from the Fighter, Adept and Bard classes, and you've a fearsome
warrior caster.
**Keep in mind however that Avorkarth is a low powered world
where the mystical and wondrous are exactly that. Even a single talent from any
category puts a character way ahead of the average of their kind.**
While a player could technically mix and match 30+ class talents to create a
really powerful character, to be as such would require quite the fairy tale of
a backstory. Be prepared to reason as to why the character has the talents they
do if you pick many.

### CLASS CATEGORIES/RANKS
While many of the classes can be used by any character, there are more
specialized classes that are evolutions or progressions of earlier classes.
An example of this would be the Karthian knight or assassin. These are classes
that become available once a certain number of talents were chosen prior and
need certain requirements met. Classes range from Rank 1 to Rank 6 in terms
of power and complexity

### CLASS REQUIREMENTS
Sometimes a class will have one or more requirements to be met before any of the
talents can be taken. Most often, this would be a certain level of mastery in one
of its subjects, or a certain amount of talents from other classes. For example,
a character needs 2 rogue talents and 2 fighter talents before they can take any
assassin talents.

### RACIAL/SPECIES CLASSES
The class talents are shown on the species' page in the lore book. This is due
to each culture having their own classes, often due to certain gods granting
powers or ways of the past anchoring their methods. This makes it so that each
area has their own specialities, such as the karthian's priests of Eonna compared
to the sharassian's priests of Orsir.

### CLASS RARITY
While techincally speaking each character can have their own class talents and
the such, as noted earlier said adventurers or specialist are rare. Even the
most basic of classes, such as the fighter or scholar are paths taken by very few.
Nonetheless, as rare as they are, they are common compared to other paths.
The class rarities are as follows.
* (C)Common 1 per 250
* (U)Uncommon 1 per 2,500
* (R)Rare 1 per 25,000
* (F)Fabled 1 per 250,000
* (L)Legendary 1 per 1,000,000
* (M)Mythical Only a few per age
