### TRADE SKILLS
Unlike the traditional Natural and Learned skills, which each have singular
specific checks and results, trade skills all roll off of the same challenges.

### INSPIRATION TRADE SKILLS

them to greater heights. If multiple inspiration trade skills are used,
the highest DC beaten is used. The bonuses given by DC's also give all previous
tier bonuses.

**Difficulty Check/Bonus** : Choose from one :
* Terrible -1 to all roll results
* Uninspired - 1 to all roll values
* Basic
* 5 - Fine +1 Will for the day. (+1 per tier)
* 8 - Beautiful +1 to one's highest skill value
* 12 - Graceful +1 to all skill attempt values.
* 17 - Elegant +1 to all roll values
* 23 - Alluring +2 to all roll values
* 30 - Enthralling +1 to all roll results
* 45 - Divine Increase all previous bonuses by 1.

3 stages lower than your skill value.

### CRAFT TRADE SKILLS
These skill are used to create things of astonishing quality. While each trade
has its own use, they will not be listed here in extreme detail as the variety
of objects that can be created are too many to list, and it is mostly up to the
DM to say what the result entails.

**Checks** : Once per created object.

**Difficulty Check/Bonus** : Object dependant.

**Armour Penalty** : No

**Combat Uses** : None.

**Additional** : See Trade Skill Bonuses.

**Critical Success** : A mistake is a happy accident. The object is an even
greater masterpiece than intended.

### TRADE SKILL BONUSES
Trade skills often also grow the creature's ability in a few other skills,
though not as quickly as if they had focused solely on that one aspect.
Increase the related skills by half the value of the trade skill, rounded down.
Limited skills still apply their further halving to this bonus.
