# ALIGNMENTS

## ALIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS

### NEUTRAL - “SURVIVOR”
Neutral characters only seek to continue living and are the most common type of
character. They do not care that their actions fall between good or evil,
law or chaos, as long as they do not go hungry or thirsty. Should a conflict
occur, neutral characters would seek the side that aids them the most.

### TRUE NEUTRAL - “SEEKER”
True Neutral characters seek the truth of all things, be it in the balance of
the mind and heart, the mysteries of the arcane or the secrets of life and death.
They are the seekers, who do not judge but simply listen and learn. They are
much rarer than the traditional Neutral characters.

### NEUTRAL GOOD - “CHAMPION”
Neutral good characters seek to bring good and well-being wherever they travel.
They treat others well, counsel and aid those in need and will go out of their
way to do the right thing, as long as this does not bring harm to those close
to them or that which they consider good. In times of darkness, Neutral characters
will defend those who follow their path, but are not entirely vindictive to
those willing to repent, accordingly letting live those who have done evil as
long as they are punished accordingly.

### NEUTRAL EVIL - “VILLAIN”
Neutral Evil characters are those willing to do evil to further their own agenda.
They seek to better their standing in life and are ready to do harm to others
should it aid them in achieving this goal. Neutral Evil characters are quick to
bargain and to scheme in the event of tragedy, seeking to aid themselves before
anyone else can capitalize on the happenings. Characters of this alignment have
no problem with evil acts as long as they gain something out of it, but will not
gain extreme pleasure nor remorse from the action.

### LAWFUL NEUTRAL - “JUDGE"
Lawful Neutral characters are those not easily swayed to good or evil and who
act upon an iron moral code. These characters will listen and find their path
upon the facets of information given to them, often making their decision based
solely upon what knowledge is currently available. They usually do not act rashly,
but they are surprisingly stubborn once their decision is made, unless additional
information comes to light. Whenever an event of destruction occurs, they will
investigate to know what truly happened so as to make a proper judgement.

### CHAOTIC NEUTRAL - “WHIMSIC”
Chaotic Neutral characters do whatever they wish to, whenever it comes to them,
without regard to the end destination or reward. Chaotic Neutral characters may
seem to distrust authority, but it is more truthful to say that these characters
are simply spontaneous and are given to a wider range of quick-minded thoughts
which drift to individuality as well as freedom per person. Should a tragedy occur,
these characters will often give their skills to use, though as to why, none but
the character can really say. Chaotic Neutral characters tend to be questioning,
curious and whimsical, and with a dislike or rules and restrictions.

### LAWFUL GOOD - “CRUSADER"
Lawful Good characters follow a given ruleset, be it divine scripture or a
personal code, that tells of virtues. These characters are set in their ways of
good and will always aid those that are within their care, no matter the cost.
They stand before darkness and evil always, their rules guiding their every action.
However, this also makes them hard to reason with, and a Lawful Good character
will carry out their duty against wrong-doers and creatures their code views as
evil, their forgiveness very hard to gain.
