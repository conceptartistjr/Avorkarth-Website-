# ABILITY SCORES

{{< snippet >}}<div class="bookpage-columns"><div class="bookpage-column">{{< /snippet >}}

## SOCIAL ABILITY SCORES

### WISDOM (WIS)
Wisdom represents a character's action knowledge and ability to read people.
Characters with high wisdom will usually know what to do and how to react in
most situations. Wisdom therefore increases many skills in which being alert
and mindful is the most appropriate action to survive.

### CHARISMA (CHA)
Charisma represents a character's overall ability to speak, persuade and
influence a target through speech. Characters with high charisma seem to know
exactly which words will make things go their way. Charisma is very useful for
characters who wish to resolve situations through speech and reasoning

### BEAUTY (BEA)
Beauty represents a character's physical attractiveness and elegance.
Characters with a high beauty score have an easier time being accepted by most
races and will find themselves in less trouble overall. However, beauty without
wit or charm only gets a character so far and is the least effective method of
influencing a target over time.
