<!--CHANGES-->
<table><tr><td>
<h2> MOST RECENT NEWS/CHANGES</h2>

<h3>8th Apr. 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>World Lore/Timeline</b>
<br> -- Added dates to each point of the timeline for prior to creation as well as the
first two ages.
<br> -- Further detailed much of the first two ages and creation, starting to consider for the many civilizations
of importance in the 5th age of Avorkarth, as well as fixing plot holes.
<br> -- Added a new painting to the timeline.
<br> -- Added extra details and a 9th version of the World Map to better show the added parts
of the timeline.

<h3>11th Mar 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
<br> -- Added 3 more rough pages for Chapter 2.

<h3>7th Mar 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook : Ability Scores/Combat Attributes</b>
<br> -- Reworked the wounds/health system for all creatures. Wounds are now split into
"Wounds", "Lesser Wounds" and "Minor Wounds". These all heal at different rates, with wounds
not healing unless specified.
<br> -- Reworked non-lethal damage/wounding system to better match the new Wound system.
<br> -- Reworked how combat damage is dealt, removing the idea of size differences and 
toughness, instead, damage is now simply dealt, with bonuses given for the differnce in 
creature's strengths. (So that a fairy punching a giant doesn't really do much.)
<br> -- Reworked Natural Armour, it being a special talent instead of being based on 
a creature's constitution score.
<br><b>Rulebook : Combat</b>
<br> -- Reworked the initiative and action system so that a creature's agility and instinct
are more independant instead of being squished into a single score. Agility is how often
a creature can act in a round, while instinct is now how quickly they act 
compared to other creatures.
<br> -- Removed a few variation of interaction timers (Free/Immediate Actions).
<br> -- Rewrote the rules to enacting combat to fit the new initiative and action systems.
<br><b>Rulebook : Weapons/Armour</b>
<br> -- Reworked all of the weapons' damage and might, and changing how weapon types
have changed. (This is most probably a temporary fix. It works for now, but I will be looking
into these systems more in the near future.)
<br> --  Armours are much stronger as with the removal of toughness,
a creature's Constitution doesn't increase armour values at all anymore.
I also changed the weapon breaking system to function better with might instead of damage. (Due 
to the changes in the wound systems.)
</p>

<h3>2nd Feb 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Worldlore : Creatures</b>
<br> -- Rewrote part of the Hiran/Centaur page, as it was obviously written while very tired last time.
<br><b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
<br> -- Added the roughs for the first 13 pages of Chapter 2! Slowly but surely.
</p>

<h3>13th Dec 2022</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Worldlore : Creatures / Website</b>
<br> -- Updated the world map to V9. This change is to make the realm more human-centric and low-fantasy, with elder
races and species to the east and with smaller lands, and the west as the human versus human medieval age. This makes
the myths and legends of Avorkarth not something often seen by most humans.
<br><b>Worldlore : Creatures / Website</b>
<br> -- Redesigned the creatures page to make it more visual. Each species will now have
paintings as their "button", instead of simple text. Many of them still don't have
descriptions, details or stats.
<br> -- Added over twenty new artworks for the creature species.
<br> -- Updated many creatures with TBDs, as I'm still unhappy with how a few stats/rules work. They'll
be updated once I've found solutions.
</p>

<h3>19th Sep 2022</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Adventures : The Sunrise Inn</b>
<br> -- Added the full notes, important interactions and descriptions to the final map.
<br> -- Updated the final maps' images.
<br> -- Updated many other minor sections of the adventure to sync up with the few
changes I did since its original creation, playtest and rule changes.
</p>

<h3>29th Aug 2022</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Adventures : The Sunrise Inn</b>
<br> -- Added the full notes, important interactions and descriptions to the eighteenth map.
<br> -- Updated the eighteenth maps' images.
</p>

<h3>22nd Aug 2022</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Adventures : The Sunrise Inn</b>
<br> -- Added the full notes, important interactions and descriptions to the sixteenth
and seventeenth map.
<br> -- Updated the sixteenth and seventeenth maps' images.
