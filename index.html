<!--CHANGES-->

<h2> MOST RECENT NEWS/CHANGES</h2>

<h3>Xth May. 2023</h3>
I WAS CURRENTLY AT MASTERY (Rewriting mastery section -
- Swap Interactions and Mastery in Rulebook order.
<br><br>
<i>I've been working behind the scenes on a large change across the board of Avorkarth. 
I originally intended for Avorkarth to 
be a low-fantasy realm but I noted that I did the mistake I most feared with power-creep and
have added too much "normalcy" to the fantasy aspect. The changes made are to revert the realm back
to what I had originally intended. A mostly human realm, with the fantasy aspects being fantastical.
Secondly, the rules were a bit too complicated, so I tuned down some of the rules and removed
most rules that had multipliers/divisers while keeping all the stats the same. It should
be easier overall to pick up and play, but still have enough complexity for immersion.</i>
<br><b>Rulebook</b>
<br>ABILITY SCORES - 
<br> -- Re-added Toughness as an attribute due to the changes to wounds, weapons and armours.

<br>ATTRIBUTES - 
<br> -- Reduced all sizes and reaches. Creatures are overall much smaller than before (although
a dragon is still massive compared to a human.)
<br> -- Added the World Lore languages and descriptions to the rulebook under the rules of
languages. Updated the language mastery costs alongside the update to mastery.
<br> -- Updated the ability scores' effect on attributes to reflect the changes to 
ability scores over the many previous changes.

<br>MASTERY -
<br> -- Reworked the Mastery system to be easier and more consistent across the board. 
Each bonus is now in the +/- 1 range instead of arbitrary numbers.
<br> -- Removed the overwritten/convoluted Weapon and Combat mastery system. The +/- system works
for the updated combat and weaponry as well.
<br> -- Re-added classes and have further added talents. (For now, only the base classes have
talents. These will probably be changed over the next updates as they are preliminary.)

<br>INTERACTIONS -
<br> -- Redid a few of the interactions to work with the combat changes, and added a few that 
were missing.

<br>SKILLS -
<br> -- Updated many skill resolves due to the changes in mastery.
<br> -- Removed all the skill type benefits and negatives due to the changes to mastery.
<br> -- Fixed many spelling and grammatical errors.
<br> -- The tumble skill was changed to simply "reduce" the amount of tiles fallen.
<br> -- The heal skill was changed to removing minor wounds, due to the change in 
the wound/damage system.

<br>COMBAT - 
<br> -- Updated the wound system to differentiate between minor/lesser/lethal wounds.
<br> -- Removed the harsh penalties to Ranged Attacks.
<br> -- Added immobilisation rules to dodge so that the fantasy of playing an assassin can actually 
function with the new wound system.
<br> -- Removed the parry/block rules. Parrying is now in the striking section as a simpler rule.
<br> -- Resistances now function with the same rules as armour.
<br> -- Made the combat round rules simpler to, removing a few dice rolls that were unnecessary.
<br> -- Removed the damage part of rolling. Now it's simply hit -> strike instead of hit -> strike -> damage.

<br>EQUIPMENT - 
<br> -- Removed all damage increases by metallic components, leaving only might increases.
<br> -- Updated many items +/- values to be smaller to better match the lore.
---- LOOKING AT EQUIPMENT! THIS IS WHERE ----

<br> -- The change towards might means that the numbers may get a bit higher 
than I wished... This problem is also because humans have a score of 10 as base,
which is quite high. As noted, damage done is reduced by the user's strength 
difference too. That feels tacky though. (But it works... As long as mortal
wounds remain the same. 1 to 1, as it were.) Death by a thousand cuts becomes
a lot stronger with this... 

<br> -- Removed damage from all weaponry. Damage dealt is simply a matter of
hitting an opponent. (Special rules for things such as natural weapons are 
per weapon.) (DONE IN COMBAT!)


<br><b>World Lore</b>
<br> -- Changed the scaling of creatures to return to a smaller more "low fantasy" scale that
I prefer. I noted that I was starting to power creep the world. 'Tis a tricky one.
<br> -- Following the previous note of "low fantasy"; Removed all the creatures of Lazras' Treaty
and their attached lore. They were too "high fantasy" for my taste. The deities and cultures will 
remain, but the species will be merged into a humanoid one that worships the jungle gods, instead
of jungle beast-men that are alike visually to their gods. It makes creatures of beast/humanoid mixing
an extreme rarity instead of a commonplace thing.


<h3>17th June 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>World Lore/Creatures</b>
<br> -- Added images for the following creatures : Moon Lynx, Phoenix, Hobgoblin, Thresher Siren

<h3>27th May 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
<br> -- Added the last rough pages for Chapter 2.

<h3>12th May 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>World Lore/Creatures</b>
<br> -- Changed the beasts section of Creatures to split between "common beasts" and
"rare beasts". 
<br> -- The current Creature images have been locked to a size so they don't stetch/squish anymore.
<br> -- Added images for the following creatures : Couatl, Banshee, Sphinx
<br> -- Updated the Karthian statistics to function with the current rules.

<h3>18th Apr. 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>World Lore/Creatures</b>
<br> -- Added images for the following creatures : Giants, Gnomes, Mermaids/Tritons, Shocker Lizards, 
Sirens(beast) and Mephits.
<br><b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
<br> -- Added 4 more rough pages for Chapter 2.

<h3>8th Apr. 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>World Lore/Timeline</b>
<br> -- Added dates to each point of the timeline for prior to creation as well as the
first two ages.
<br> -- Further detailed much of the first two ages and creation, starting to consider for the many civilizations
of importance in the 5th age of Avorkarth, as well as fixing plot holes.
<br> -- Added a new painting to the timeline.
<br> -- Added extra details and a 9th version of the World Map to better show the added parts
of the timeline.

<h3>11th Mar 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
<br> -- Added 3 more rough pages for Chapter 2.

<h3>7th Mar 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook : Ability Scores/Combat Attributes</b>
<br> -- Reworked the wounds/health system for all creatures. Wounds are now split into
"Wounds", "Lesser Wounds" and "Minor Wounds". These all heal at different rates, with wounds
not healing unless specified.
<br> -- Reworked non-lethal damage/wounding system to better match the new Wound system.
<br> -- Reworked how combat damage is dealt, removing the idea of size differences and 
toughness, instead, damage is now simply dealt, with bonuses given for the differnce in 
creature's strengths. (So that a fairy punching a giant doesn't really do much.)
<br> -- Reworked Natural Armour, it being a special talent instead of being based on 
a creature's constitution score.
<br><b>Rulebook : Combat</b>
<br> -- Reworked the initiative and action system so that a creature's agility and instinct
are more independant instead of being squished into a single score. Agility is how often
a creature can act in a round, while instinct is now how quickly they act 
compared to other creatures.
<br> -- Removed a few variation of interaction timers (Free/Immediate Actions).
<br> -- Rewrote the rules to enacting combat to fit the new initiative and action systems.
<br><b>Rulebook : Weapons/Armour</b>
<br> -- Reworked all of the weapons' damage and might, and changing how weapon types
have changed. (This is most probably a temporary fix. It works for now, but I will be looking
into these systems more in the near future.)
<br> --  Armours are much stronger as with the removal of toughness,
a creature's Constitution doesn't increase armour values at all anymore.
I also changed the weapon breaking system to function better with might instead of damage. (Due 
to the changes in the wound systems.)
