					<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Attributes</u></h2>
					<p><!--The realm of Avorkarth is truly vast, and hidden within its many reaches are treasures of glory and wealth. Such things are often the goals of
					characters, be they spiritual treasure or monetary gain. To reach these goals, characters must first be able to affect and be affected
					by the world.--> Attributes are the character's ability to affect and be affected
					by the world, the statistics of the character's capabilities which can be used against the world's 
					obstacles, often against the player's will. Such things are how quickly the character moves or how many wounds they can
					take before they are downed.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Creature Size</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Size represents the approximation of how much space a creature takes upon the field, be it through height or width, split into
					the game tiles. Each tile cannot
					be shared by multiple creatures unless they are the Small scales, or a special rule allows them to be in
					the same space as another. 
					<br>Size's benefits are two-fold. Larger creatures are easier to hit but will deal more damage in return.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Placing</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p><b>Size Shapes</b>
					<br>While size dictates the overall space that a creature takes, not all large creatures are shaped the same way. As such
					a large creature does not necessarily have to be 3x3 tiles. As long as the number of occupied tiles are between 4 and 15, it'd be considered
					a large creature. (As seen below).</p>
					<table style="width:200px;margin:auto;">
						<tr><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>-</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>-</td></tr>

						<tr><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
					</table>
					
					<p><b>Long Shapes</b>
					<br>Some creatures, such as snakes, sirens or lillends, have a long tail section. Their tail sections are shown as separate tokens
					which must be connected up to the first body/head token. Each square chosen counts as a tail section. So a large snake species
					of 8 tiles with a 1 tile head would have seven tail sections.</p>
					<table style="width:200px;margin:auto;">
						<tr><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
						<tr><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>

						<tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>X</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
					</table>					

					<p><b>Front/Flank/Rear</b>
					<br>Most creatures can only face a single direction at a time. This is their front, which usually gives bonuses to defense. If
					they are attacked from the sides, that would be the flank and at worse, they are attacked from the back. 
					For creatures with a tail, attacking any part of this is counted as attacking their back.
					</p>
					
					
					<!-- Change Vision here -->
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Vision</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Vision, or Sight, is applied mostly when a character is in a darkened area, such as a cave or during the night. 
					Typical human vision in daylight can go for miles on end, but can only see about 5 tiles ahead of them while under a dark moonlit night. 
					Inhuman characters may have better or worse eyesights, which are shown below.</p>
					
					<p style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;"><b>VISION TABLE</b></p>

					<i>* Light Sensitive can see further than the 5 tiles noted, but it's very blurry. They take -1 to skills and attack values at that
					distance, decreasing by further -1 per
					3 tiles farther than the blurry value.</i>

					<!-- Change movement here next -->
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Movement</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Movement is how quickly a character moves through the world. The actual movement attribute is generally unused outside of 
					dangerous situations or combat.
					While combat is active, movement is shown as 1 for each tile, with diagonals counting as 1 and a half. A character can move 
					through these tiles at the rate of their chosen movement 
					attribute, as long as they are not occupied.</p>
					<!--
					<p style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;"><b>RUNNING SPEED</b></p>
					<table>
						<tr><td> Agility Score + 2 per Size Category</td></tr>
					</table>-->			
					
					<p><b> Maneuverability </b>
					<br>This determines the ease of travel for the character upon different terrains.
					<br> <b>- Perfect</b> : The character may move freely.
					<br> <b>- Good</b> : The character cannot move in diagonals, but can turn in the same move action.
					<br> <b>- Rough</b> : The character may only move in a straight line and must take a second move action to turn.</p>					
					
					
					<p><b>Agile Movement</b>
					<br>While movement is mostly determined by racial bases, it can be increased or decreased by the character's Agility. Each Agility
					higher or lower than the racial base average increases their highest movement by 1. Each 2 Agility increases the rest by 1.</p>
					
					<p><b>Sprinting</b>
					<br>A character may use two movement actions in a turn to sprint. If so used, they may add +1 to their total movement, +1 more per 5
					in their Run speed.
					
					<p><b>Swimming/Climbing </b>
					<br>Though swimming and climbing are skills, they technically are movement sub-sets as well. Characters who attempt to swim through 
					deep waters
					or climb steep mountain-sides may do so only if they pass the skill check.</p>
					
					<p><b> Flying </b>
					<br>Characters that have a flying movement speed may use it instead of moving regularily. Their distance from the ground 
					(moving "up") counts as movement as well and
					must be noted. Flight can only be used if the character is in their Light or lower lifting capacity.</p>
					
					<!--<p><i><b>Example!</b> : A character that has Flying (Good) 30 feet, may go 15 feet forward then 15 feet to the right in one turn. 
					Characters can only fly if they are below their light load lifting capacity.</i></p>

					<br> - Stormy ocean - DC : 24 || Overhang - DC : 22
					<br> - Whirlpool - DC : 26 || Ceiling with handholds - DC : 24 -->
					
					
					<p><b>Falling </b>
					<br> Falling is commonplace in areas of danger. Cliffs, traps, ravines and ledges are all obstacles where falling is possible. Falling
					damage begins once the drop is 2 tiles or greater (+1 tile per Size difference greater than medium). For each tile above the fall damage 
					distance, the character takes 2 lethal damage, reduced by the character's tumble skill roll.</p>

					<p><b> Breathing Underwater/Holding a breath </b>
					<br>If the character is not amphibious, they
					may hold their breath underwater a number of rounds equal to 5 + their constitution score. Afterwards, they take 1 lethal 
					damage per round.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Lifting Capacity</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Upon their journeys and adventures, characters are often burdened with gear, treasures and items of various usefulness.
					Unfortunately, characters can only carry so much, determined in part by their Strength Ability Score and in part by their Size.
					Strength determines the character's maximum weight allowance, including gear being worn.
					Lifting Capacity determines the total weight of all objects upon the character's person that they may carry before
					becoming burdened. Different penalties or bonuses are given based upon their current weight and strength.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Multiple Values (Optional)</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The lifting capacity of a character may be choosen from any lifting capacity between the ability below up to their maximum
					in the chart. As
					an example, a character whose strength tier is 6 has a light carrying capacity from 20 to 40. Choose that which makes the most 
					sense to the character.

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Lifting Capacity Penalties</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>When reaching a threshold of the character's lifting capacity, the character unfortunately takes on penalties to their movement
					as well as movement based attributes.
					<p><b>Light load or lower</b> : No Penalties
					<br><b>Light to Medium load</b> : -1 to Dodge value, Movement and Agility based skills.
					<br><b>Medium to Heavy load</b> : Halve Dodge, Movement and Agility skill values or -2 (worse one).
					<br><b>Heavy Load to Maximum</b> : Cannot Dodge, 1 tile movement, can only use non-movement based skills and only one 
					action per turn.
					<br><b>Greater than Maximum Load</b> : Cannot move or take any actions.
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Carrying Capacity</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p> No matter a character's strength, their carrying amount is unfortunately still limited by their size. A character
					may only carry so many items of certain sizes, as noted below. Each item size is equivalent to a medium sized creature
					and increases along with. So a standard sized sword for a medium creature is a large sword for a small creature.</p>
					
					<p>Note as well that clothing or armour does NOT count towards this capacity, but worn items such as swords and backpacks
					do.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Languages</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">

					<p>All civilized cultures throughout the realm of creation have created specialized forms of communication. These languages
					are often complex vocalizations unique to their species, although that doesn't mean that they aren't learnable. The complexity 
					of a language is shown by a points score. Depending on how many points within a language the character has, they may either
					understand, speak or read and write the said language.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Additional Languistic Points</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p><b> Intelligence</b> : At intelligence 5, a character gains 1 additional language point. For every point of intelligence above,
					the character may gain up to 1 additional language point per 10 years of age, to a maximum of 3 times their intelligence tier.
					<br><i>Example : A character with an intelligence of 6 would have 2 language point at the age of 20+ and 3 at the age of 30+, 
					up to a maximum of 18. If their
					intelligence is 7, they would get 3 languge points at the age of 20+ and 5 at the age of 30+, to a maximum of 21.</i>
					<p><b> Backstory</b> : Languages learned by the character MUST match their backstory. If a highly intelligent character would include
					draconic in their language, they must have a method of learning said language in their backstory. 
					Alternatively, if a character is not of high enough intelligence but the character's backstory truly demands that they know a certain
					language outside of their usual, this can be brought up to the GM and added as well if it fits fine.</p>

					simplistic and direct at conveying information. Even those not of the central lands have used it for trade and venture. 
					<br><b>Dwalai</b> : The language spoken by the humans of the sands and dunes of Sharas. Other than Karthan, it is by far the most
					spoken language of trade.
					<br><b>Tildar</b> : The harsh language of the Tildran people. Due to their current status as a human sub-species, Tildar
					is viewed as the language of the slave class.
					<br><b>Orcish</b> : This guttural language is the lowest form of demonic and cannot express many complex ideas quickly. It is, however,
					surprsingly well developped for any combat and warlike situations.
					<br><b>Skord</b> : The language of the humans of the north, it is wonderful at embelleshing and adding details to ever aid the great
					sagas sung in the halls of greater men.</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br>
					<p><b>Delnen</b> : It is the precursor language of Karthan and is still used by Karthan
					clergy for their prayers and litanies. Only the Daelden of the south still use this elder language as a means of communication. 
					<br><b>Xing</b> : The flowing language of the Xia humans is like its land. It is soft and complex, full of philosophy and mystery,
					with certain words able to mean many things depending on the context of the phrase.
					<br><b>Runic (Dwarven)</b> : The Runnoc language is their most important aspect, for it shapes their whole way of life. From language
					comes rules and runes, which in turn gives civilization and might.
					<br><b>Nareth (Low-Elven)</b> : A simpler version of their past language of Silden, the Narei elves decided to change their language to
					be more open to others after leaving their golden lands.
					<br><b>Silden (High-Elven)</b> : The beautiful flowing language of an older age, the true words of old Silden are forgotten but by a very
					few. It is nonetheless still used as a spoken language, though without its power, by Aelvenkin.
					<br><b>Ignan, Auran, Terran, Aquan + Other elemental languages</b> : These strange sounds are often mistaken for simply trying to recreate
					the sounds of nature itself.
					<br><b>Necril</b> : The language of the dead, even the mortals that use it know that every word feels wrong to speak.
					<br><b>Faeic</b> : The quick and whispering language of the small fae-folk. To those who do not understand it, it is like a small chime
					, often mistaken for the wind.
					<br><b>Draconic</b> : Too proud in their ancient days of old to use the then language of sylvan, the dragons were the first to create
					a language only for themselves. For this pride, it is deep, loud and unmistakably royal.
					<br><b>Treant</b> : The living trees felt the whispers of sylvan long ago and learnt to copy a rough, groaning version of it over the eons.
					<br><b>Celestial</b> : The ringing, clarion words of those who serve and are born of holy magic.
					<br><b>Daemonic</b> : This deep, but lyrical language is used by the creatures and servants of the five halls.
					<br><b>Abyssal</b> : The language of ancient evils is dark, dreary and feels as if one is drowning while speaking it.
					<br><b>Sylvan</b> : The soothing, musical language of the nymphs and their spirit guides that is able to create life itself.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Health (Constitution)</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The total health a character has represents the amount of wounds that the character can take before either falling unconscious or dying. 
					There are two ways of wounding a character, one being Non-Lethal attacks (Hit points) and the other being Lethal attacks (Health points).</p>
					
					<p style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;"><b>HEALTH</b></p>
					<table>
						<tr><td style="width:30%"><b>Total Wounds</b></td><td>Constitution + Other bonuses</td></tr>
					</table>

					
					<p><b>Non-lethal Damage</b> : Whenever a character takes enough wounds from a non-lethal amount to surpass their health total, they
					fall into the unconcious state.
					<br>If the character has equal non-lethal wound points to their health, they fall into the unconscious or the bleeding out states. 
					<br>If the character has wound points equal to their Health Points, they die.</p>
					
					<p><b>Unconscious State</b> : While in such a state, the character cannot move or take any actions and is essentially
					removed from the game until after the combat ends, where they are then awake once more at 1 <u>Hit</u> point. Any non-lethal damage taken
					after the character falls unconscious is converted to lethal damage.
					
					<p><b>Bleeding Out State</b> : If a character falls unconscious from lethal damage, they reach the bleeding out state instead. They begin 
					taking 1 lethal damage per round.</p>
					
					<p><b>Lethal and Non-Lethal interaction</b>
					<br>Should a character take Lethal damage, it deals <u>both</u> lethal and non-lethal damage for equal amounts. However, if a character
					takes non-lethal damage, it only affects the non-lethal hit points.</p>	
					
					<p><b>Regaining Hit Points</b>
					<br>Hit points are regained by simply resting, returning at 1 + 1 per positive Constitution ability score per 8 hours rest. Hit points
					cannot ever go above the current health points of the character.</p>

					<p><b>Regaining Health Points (Heal Counter)</b> 
					<br>Health points cannot be regained by simply resting, and the wounds must be taken care of with the heal skill or magic. Every wound
					point requires 10 heal counters.</p>

					<p>The attack value attribute is used in combat to determine the effectiveness of a character ability with weaponry, be it sword, bow, fist,
					claw or maw. Characters may increase their melee attack by two styles, either dextrous precision or agile speed. Ranged attacks are
					only increased by the precision of the character.
					The attack values are compared against the Dodge defense and any attack value below 1 is counted as a 1.</p>

					be declared before attacking the target.
					<Br><br>
					<b>Slashing</b> : The attack is that of a strike that slashes across the opponent in a vertical or horizontal manner. This is
					most commonly associated with blades such as swords and axes.
					<br>
					<b>Piercing</b> : The attack is that of a strike that pierces straight through the opponent. This is most commonly associated
					with arrows and bolts or small pointed weapons such as daggers.
					<br>
					<b>Crushing</b> : The attack is that of a bludgeoning strike, meant to crush or break the opponent. This is most commonly associated

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Defenses</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The Defense attributes set the character's ability to dodge and block incoming attacks. 
					Unlike the Attack Bonuses, the Defense attributes are static and are simply the numbers that 
					the attacker must compare against to deal damage.
					<!--
					<br> - The Attacker rolls for each of their attacks, rolling based off the Hit chart (see Combat section). Make sure to track all rolls 
					which did not fail to hit.
					<br> - The Attacker then rolls for wounding damage for each successful attack hit. If a wound bypasses the armor/resistance value, it deals 
					damage equal to the difference to their Health and Hit points if lethal, or Hit points only if non-lethal.-->

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Dodge</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Dodging is the primary method of defense, showing the character's ability to weave through combat and evade blows, arrows or spells.
					<!--Although effective to an incredible degree for some, others prefer the tried and trusted method of armour.
					This increases one's survivability at 
					the cost of being more restricted in movement. This restriction is called Armour Penalty and affects dodge considerably.--></p>

					<p>The secondary part of defense, should an attacking partially hit, is to block a part of the incoming damage.
					Parrying is influenced by one's arm strength to be able to hold back a blow as well as one's proficiency with weapons. 
					Parrying increases one's armour amount before calculating the armour defense.</p>
					
					<p><b>Blocking</b> : If a character has a shield, they may instead block the attack.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Armour</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Armour is the tertiary and final method of defense, from armoured plating to thick hides, it is used for any attack that isn't dodged
					or parried. It is used to counter the attacker's strike and to possibly negate incoming damage.
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Armour Types</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p><b>Full Armour</b> 
					<br>Armours are traditionally really good at defending head on, making most items or bonuses state that they give a Full Armour bonus.
					This bonus applies to any attack that is made to the character, as long as they are aware they are in combat. Therefore, 
					attacks against targets that aren't able to respond ignore both Full and Guarded Armour.
					
					<p><b>Guarded Armour</b>
					<br>Most armours, alongside shields, better protect attacks that are directed towards the front or flanks of the
					character but less so to attacks made from the back. Guarded armour values are only applied to attacks made from the front and
					flank.<!--<b> Note that Guarded armour can only reduce damage to a minimum of 1
					if the damage is higher than the Full or Natural armour value but below the Guarded!</b></p>-->
					
					<p><b>Natural Armour</b>
					<br>Some creatures have thick hides or plating. These are natural to the creature and as such cannot be countered by positioning 
					unless specifically stated. Most skin has a value of 0.

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Armour Type</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Very much like weapons, armour is separated into three categories. Whenever an attack needs to wound, the attack type is matched
					against the armour type. Just like weapons, armours are separated into <b>Slashing</b>, <b>Piercing</b> and <b>Crushing</b> defenses.
					-->
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Armour Penalty</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p><b>Armour Penalty</b> : Armour within the world will protect one's skin, but will hinder one's movement. Most armours come with an 
					Armour Penalty, which reduces two aspects. The first is a character's ability to dodge, the other in a character's ability to move 
					freely within the world with many of the physical skills. These are noted in the dodge section and skills chapter respectively.

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Resistance</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Resistances function exactly like armour, although against any effects other than physical damage. These include spells, curses or 
					environmental challenges such as lava or acid.
					<p><b>Negative Resistances</b>
					<br>Should a creature have a negative
					score in their resistances, they take reduced healing equal to the negative of the resistance from any spells of that realm, and 
					similarily take additional damage equal to the negative if ever struck by that sphere of damage.
					<br><i>For example : Undead would have negative Holy resistances, so they'd take reduced healing and increased damage from holy spells
					and effects.</i>

					Whenever an effect says that the character gains a charm or fear point, they must refer to this chart to see if any effect is

					<br><h3 style="text-align: center;">Reputation (Optional)</h3>
					<p>Reputation is a passive attribute meant as a method for the Game Master to track how certain creatures or other non-playable
					characters would react to the players. Reputation is usually linked to factions of every race, although if a Game Master wishes, or
					for simpler short campaigns, he can simply reduce it to the base per race basis. Of course, there are always exceptions to every race. 
					Those certain few who are more open to diplomacy or easier to anger.</p>
					
					<p>Reputation is split into two categories. The first is aptly named reputation, the second is fame. These work hand in hand to create
					a general picture of how the character is perceived at first notice.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Reputation vs Fame</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p><b>Reputation</b>
					<br>Reputation is simply put as how well your character is valued. This doesn't affect how well known your character is,
					it only tells how others of that race or faction will react upon seeing your character. Note that reputation can be split from the
					specific to the overall, and is where fame helps out.
					<br><i>E.g. : An harpy character can be well liked by a human village they helped save from a maurauding orc band, but they will still
					be quickly hunted or chased by humans of other areas if they aren't known for their heroic act.</i></p>
					
					<p><b>Fame</b>
					<br>Fame shows how well a character is known upon the continent of Avorkarth, be they famous or infamous. The greater the fame,
					the more likely the character is to be recognized, even if it's only for the city guards to quickly try to lock them up.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Reputation Lists</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Reputation lists are where the player may note down and track their reputation. 
					It is the Game Master's duty to create a Reputation sheet for the campaign they made. If they pick a pre-existing campaign,
					a reputation sheet would be already created for them, including all required factions that the players would meet as they go through
					the story. If one is to create a reputation sheet, keep in mind that each race (To be implemented...) has pre-existing racial
					reputations in their lore section.
					<br><i>E.g. : Humans would have a friendly reputation with the Narei elves, as they've often allied against darker causes.</i></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Specific Reputation vs. Racial Reputation</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>While individuals can be influenced and learn to trust or even admire those not of their own race, the overall racial reputations never
					change. This is due to it being more of a guideline, a reasonable guess of how members of that species will do in response of meeting
					the character. 
					<br>Compare this with the character's reputation with a guild or a particular caste, where the members would be told of the 
					character, including their appearance and past actions. This would make them either more reasonable or aggressive, depending on 
					the reputation and fame amongst them.</p>
					
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Reputation Chart</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Together, fame and reputation mark your character upon the Reputation Chart, giving a title of sorts for each faction that the player
					knows of, with neutral in the middle of it all. Reputation dictates the direction of the chart, and Fame dictates the distance from
					the neutral point.</p>
