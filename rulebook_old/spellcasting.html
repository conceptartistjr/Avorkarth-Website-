					<h2 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:0;"><u>Spellcasting</u></h2>
					<p>Upon the rarest of nights there are some that swear of hearing incantations upon faintest of winds, and feel that the world has somehow changed.
					This belief of magical and supernatural superstitions is often laughed at, mocked and belittled, though could not be more true. Magic,
					though extremely rare, is 
					very much a part of Avorkarth. Eldritch powers and ancient spiritual beings are present within the deep areas of the world, while servants to
					the gods enact rituals to gain favor and blessings for their kin or personal power and wizards construct arcane studies that 
					live long after they pass from the age as newly attuned are born in the cycle.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Spellcasting Rarity</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Magic is truly rare within Avorkarth, and most of its mortal races live their entire lives without its presence, especially its most common, 
					humanity. The magical and
					supernatural are hidden away and even beneficial magic is looked upon with fear and distrust. Only answered prayers that come from some divine
					calling or a miracle from the light based gods are at times viewed with grace and kindness among the commonfolk, and even then, 
					usually only if it is from
					the gods of their race. Should a non-magical character wish to become a spellcaster class, or has magical powers due to racial benefits, they 
					would best be weary of using such things around the commonfolk, for not all react well to it.
					<br><br>
					Although magic is extremely rare, it is equally powerful, the lowliest of spells easily being equal to the might of a sword and able to turn
					the tide of a battle.			

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Spellcasting Types</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Magic at its core is split into three types :
					<br>- <b>Devotion</b>, which is magic gifted from divine powers or ancient beings used by the priests, worshippers and enforcers of certain 
						deities or mighty beings. 
					<br>- <b>Arcane</b>, which is magic that is derived from the laws of the world, usually used by wizards, necromancers or sorcerers and other
						traditional casters.
					<br>- <b>Spiritual</b>, which is the root of natural life that flows throughout the world, often used by fae-folk, eldritch creatures
					or similar natural casters. 			
					</p>
					
					<p>While casting spells is split into three distinct styles, the spheres of magics and their sub-sections, such as Elemental, Necromantic
					and Demonic are the actual realms from which casters draws their powers. Elemental magic, as an example, is shared between Arcane and Spiritual, 
					the former controlling it and the latter borrowing it, but both Arcane and Spirit casters are able to cast from its Sphere with varying effects.
				
				</div>
				
				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br>
			
					<h5 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Divine/Devotion - Prayers and Litanies</h5><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Though still rare, devotion spells are the most commonly seen. Devotion spells are viewed as miracles or divine intervention and rightly so. 
					Divine spells are incantations, prayers and callings upon the worshipper's deity. Through the proper words, the belief of the caster, their
					fervor to the deity being called and the intervention of the deity itself, devotion spells are able to be cast. <!--Since mortals cannot wield the 
					full power of the divines, devotion based spells may be easily called compared to the other two, but aren't capable of being more powerful
					with the power of the wielder. -->
					<br><br>
					<b>Given Power</b> : Characters have access to all the spells given by their deity, as long as they have the mana to spend. These can be called upon and
					cast at any time unless specified. Each deity has a list of spells under their names in the Lore section along with their effects.
					<br>
					<b>Deity's Chosen</b> : Devotion casters also gain bonuses given by the deity. These are listed right before the spell list.
					<br>
					<b>Place of Worship</b> : If a character is within a sanctified area of their deity, they increase their caster might by 1 for spell costs 
					and effects.
					<br><br>
					<br><br>
					<!--<b>Desperate Plea</b> : Devotion casters may attempt a Desparate Plea should they be in dire trouble. If a faith caster has 0
					of their magic points remaining, they can roll a die. On a 6 they gain equal to half their magic points to use upon a single 
					spell. This can only be done once per week. If it fails, the caster's will goes down to 1 and they reduce all their ability scores by 2 until
					the week has passed.-->
					
					<h5 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Arcane/Ley-Line - Incantations and Spells</h5><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The mystical art of sorcery is one shrouded by mystery and superstition, yet is one of powers beyond imagining. Arcane spells are 
					similarily cast with incantations, yet only function as an infusion of the caster's magical attunement alongside their knowledge of the spell
					itself. To gain attunement to the arcane, practitioners will usually study ancient texts and tomes, have a well of power already within them,
					or find a darker path of bargains with ancient powers.
					<br><br>
					<b>Spell Memorization</b> : Characters who study the arcane can memorize a certain number of spells equal to their twice their intelligence score. 
					<br>
					<b>Arcane Tome</b> : Arcane casters must write down all of their magical incantations and spells that they've discovered.
					This tome allows arcanists to spend a single action to find any non-memorized spell that they've learnt or discovered, which then may
					be cast during this or the next round of combat.
					<br>
					<b>Changing Memorized Spells</b> : Arcane casters may rememorize different spells by spending a 8 hours reading their Arcane Tome. These
					must be spells written in their tome and they may memorize a number of spells equal to their intelligence score.</p>

					<h5 style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:center;">Spirit/Natural - Unbound Power</h5><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>The elusive and nearly invisble power that creates life itself is known to very few and detectable by ever fewer. This power that has
					been within all things since the beginning of the Realm of Creation is most present and powerful within lands of unbound
					growth. It is the basis of all ancient and spiritual magics, echoes of the first ages' songs. Spiritual magic appears within areas of the world
					where nature is respected and a more primal view is upheld. For this reason, it has been disappearing, its subtle flow ignored
					by the fast paced lives of most younger mortal races and dissipating from areas of populated civilization and reckless construction.
					<br><br>
					<b>Inner Power</b> : Characters attuned to Spiritual magic may cast any spell from within their sphere of magic without restriction. 
					Spiritual casting is similar to a whim or a feeling more than a precise incantation. The might and matter of the spell depends 
					more on the power within the caster
					than any other reason. <!--Their spells usually have no base powers and rely heavily on the user's spiritual might.--></p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Mana</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>All spellcasters use an invisible force that is throughout the world. While each caster type also uses it in a slightly different manner,
					it essentially has the same origination. Any caster character of note has 5 mana base, increasing by 1 per caster might category. (see below).
					The amount of mana used per spell is based upon the power of the spell and the amount of time used to cast it.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Regaining Mana</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p> Each caster type regains 1 mana per day, with special actions to speed up this process.</p>
					
					<p><b>DEVOTION CASTERS</b>
					<br><b>Prayer</b> : The character may sit in uninterrupted prayer to their deity, regaining 1 mana point per 12 hours.
					If they have an icon of worship with them, increase the bonus by another 1. If the character is within a sanctified area of their deity,
					they reduce the time to gain their reverence by half, regaining their mana
					every 6 hours instead.</p>
					<!-- Make this a special for HOLY CASTERS?<br><b>Special - Desperate Plea : </b> The caster may attempt a Desperate Plea when they are in dire trouble. By using up the remainder
					of their reverence points, they can roll a die. On a 5+, they regain equal to double the spent reverance points to use upon a single spell.
					If it fails, the caster's will is reduced by 5 and they reduce all ability scores by 1 for the next week.</p>-->	

					<p><b>ARCANE CASTERS</b>
					<br><b>Ley Reserve</b> : Arcane casters naturally regain an additional mana per day.
					<br><b>Syphon</b> : The caster may touch any arcane magical object to regain mana equal to the level of the spell on the item. The magical
					item loses all magical qualities until energy is refocused into the item. Should the level of the spell on the magical item
					surpass the caster's might, they take 3 lethal damage per spell level higher.</p>

					<p><b>SPIRIT CASTERS</b>
					<br><b>Nature Bound</b> : Spirit casters regain 1 mana per X amount of time, slowing significantly while in areas without spiritual life.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:0;">Casting Spells</h3>
					
					<p>Whenever a spellcaster wishes to use magic in any form, they must weave the mana flowing through the world into a tangible result. 
					This is the art of spellcasting. While dependant per the power and ability of the caster, magic is technically cast in the same way
					for all. It requires the spell, the caster's own power spent and an amount of time.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Casting Time</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<!-- CHANGE THIS TO BE, INCREASE TIME, INCREASE CASTER LEVEL COST. EASIER TO FOLLOW THAT WAY! -->
					<p>To all spellcasters, time is a very important matter as the greater the caster's concentration upon a spell, the less it costs upon their
					body and mind. Casting time is based upon how many actions it takes, show in the table below.
					<br><br><b>Time Limitation</b> : Spells do not benefit from Swiftness,
					and only two standard action spells may be cast per round. Should two standard action spells be used, only movement actions may
					be used for the remainder of that character's round.
					<br><br><b>Cantrips/Orisons</b> : If a spell cost is lower than 0.25, it is considered free. A caster may cast up to their caster's
					might of free spells per turn.
					<br><br><b>Ritual</b> : If a spell cast time is greater than
					an hour, it is considered a ritual. (See the ritual section).</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Spell Levels</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Depending on how much mana is spent into spells, they may grow exponentially in power. Whenever a 
					certain amount of mana is spent, the spell is upgraded to the next tier and all the effects increase as well.
					Whenever a spell is upgraded to its next level, the caster may choose to use any component of it from a lower
					level.</p>
					
					<p>Certain spells have higher base levels, meaning that the effect of the spell is too high at its very base, although
					they may also be upgraded. Similarily, some spells cannot be increased any further than a certain level. All of this
					is shown per spell. </p>
				
				</div>
				
				<div class="page_inner_halfw">
					<br><br><br>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Permanent Spells</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Most spells can be made permanent withou the caster requiring to keep concentrating, however the cost to do so is tremendous. Any spell, enchantments
					or similar effect that is to be permanent (such as creating a magic weapon), increases the relative cost at -16 caster might. Most often
					it takes a ritual to do any such effect.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Magic Spheres</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>All magic is contained within their particular field, also known as a magic sphere. Certain magical spheres have sub-realms of casting 
					within themselves. The magic that the caster is capable of casting is given by the class talents and racial bases, which also defines
					which of the major magic types it is. Even devotion magic casting is simply a method of accessing a sphere of magic, 
					held in partial control by the deity being called upon.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Counter-Spelling</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Whenever a spell is first cast, the surge of energy that occurs is naturally felt by any others nearby. Should another spellcaster
					be near the caster of the spell, they may attempt to dispel it as an immediate action
					by spending part of their mana to disrupt the energy flow. They may drain
					their own mana until the point it equals the level of the spell being cast. For each point over their maximum mana, the counter-speller
					takes 1 point of lethal damage up to half their maximum health points, at which point the counter-spelling fails. The spent mana used 
					does not return.
					If the opposing caster is not the same caster type, increase the caster might cost by 1.</p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Rituals</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					
					<p>Not all caster characters are mighty enough to cast certain spells, nor are most able to cast any whatsoever. However, with the aid of the
					right words, movements and ingrediants, characters may empower their capabilities beyond what is normally available to them. 
					Rituals can also be empowered by multiple people, gaining ever greater might, which have in the past enabled cults to raze the cities of 
					their enemies with magical plagues or to awaken and control eldritch creatures deep within the earth.
					<br>Rituals require the proper ingrediants and symbols, and much like arcane spells, must be known by the initiator. If any
					part of the ritual is disrupted or moved, the spell breaks down. 
					Spells that are quick cast, such as fireballs or rays, often have the ritual make the
					user inscribe the magic into an item like a wand or staff. Each spell has its required components written.</p>
					
					<p><b> Casting a Ritual</b> : Once all is set-up, then the ritual may be cast. Rituals reduce the total of the spell's cost by 1 per
					hour spent on the spell, with each point reduction costing one additional hour.</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><i> <b>Example</b> : A non-caster wishes to create a ritual for a 1st level spell. 
					Considering a non-caster has a mana pool of 2, they would require to bring the spell cost to below that. So by spending at least an hour on the spell
					they may consider their caster might as 2 higher, equivalent to a 0th might caster. This would mean that a 1st level spell now costs 6.

					<p><b> Casters and Rituals</b> : Casters of higher level than the original ritualist may use their own magic to speed up the ritual.

					<p><b>Feedback</b> : Any ritual or spell cost that is greater than 32 FROM THE ORIGINAL CASTER MIGHT has an ever increasing chance of 
					killing the caster. Every hour, roll a die per mana higher than the cost of 32. Each die that rolls a 4+ makes the caster take 1 
					Lethal point of damage. Should the original caster die due to the Feedback, the next main "caster" is chosen randomly or by any who step up. 
					The ritual now checks if the ritual is higher than the cost of 32 for the new main caster and the process repeats.<p>

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Spell Difficulty Check</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Spell DC or Spell Difficulty Check is the required resistance to deny any incoming spell effects. The DC of a spell is dependant on
					the caster's relevant attunement ability score as well as the amount of spell itself. The spell's DC must bypass the target's will for

					<p>Unless specifically stated, spells take time to cast. This is equivalent to 1 standard action per mana spent on the spell, minus

					<h2 style="text-align:center;">Spells</h2>
					<p>This section is just an example of how to read spells and gives very basic spells for those who chose to play casters with
					only what's available within the rulebook. The actual spellcasting, deity, spells lists are in the lore section.
					Most casters are much too rare for base adventurers, but players who wish to do so may with the additional 
					information in the lore	books.</p>
					
					<p>Spells have multiple components, each with their specific information.
					<br><b>Spell</b> : The name of the spell. While Devotion spells always have a singular name, Arcane and Spirit spells names change
					depending on the amount of power poured into the spell.
					<br><b>Level</b> : The level and approximate power of the spell, and therefore cost.
					<br><b>Sphere(s)</b> : The overlapping spheres of magic that the spell belongs to.
					<br><b>Range</b> : How far away the spell can "land" or be cast away from the caster.
					<br><b>Reach</b> : How large of an impact area the spell has from its range base point. The caster may choose to limit the reach
					of a spell to a minimum of a single 5ft. square, but cannot make it larger than the Reach value.
					<br><b>Save</b> : The dice roll, attribute or ability score required to resist the effect of the spell. Most commonly used with
					mind control or will based spells.
					<br><b>Cast</b> : The type of spellcast the spell is, these are :
					<br><b> -- Once</b> : The spell is cast once, lasts a certain duration, then ends.
					<br><b> -- Continuous(Cont.)</b> : The spell is cast then maintainted. While the spell is maintained, the caster cannot regain
					the mana spent on the spell until they let go of the spell.<br><b>NOTE! : If the caster takes their time with a continuous spell 
					to reduce the cost, the drain is still equivalent to the ORIGINAL COST of the spell! Mana CAN go into the negatives due to this
					and will take more time to recover!</b></p>
					
					<!--
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Spell usage - Devotion vs. Arcana/Spirit</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>While devotion, arcana and spirit all require the caster to spend their mana/energy/reverence. However, while devotion spells
					have a base power and a required reverence points spent, both arcana and spirit spells' powers change depending on how much energy/spirit
					is spent within the spell.</p>
					
					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Spell tiers</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Depending on how much mana/energy is spent into arcana and spirit spells, they may grow exponentially in power. Whenever a 
					certain amount of mana/energy is spent, the spell is upgraded to the next tier and all the effects per mana/energy spent 
					increase as well.</p>-->

					<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">Rituals</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
					<p>Not all caster characters are mighty enough to cast certain spells, nor are most able to cast any whatsoever. However, with the aid of the
					right words, movements and ingrediants, characters may empower their capabilities beyond what is normally available to them. 
					Rituals can also be empowered by multiple people, gaining ever greater might, which have in the past enabled cults to raze the cities of 
					their enemies with magical plagues or to awaken and control eldritch creatures deep within the earth.
				
					<p>Rituals recreate spells as long-term goals, with each mana cost of the intended spell increasing the ritual's time required by 1 hour
					plus an additional hour per.</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><i> So a spell that would cost 3 magic points would take a non-caster 6 hours(1 + 2 + 3) to cast with
					the right ingrediants and ritualistic actions.</i></p>
					<p>Much like Arcane casters' spells, rituals require to be known before attempted, and even require special ingrediants depending on the
					sphere of magic and the might of the spell. Spells that are quick cast, such as fireballs or rays, often have the ritual make the
					user inscribe the magic into an item like a wand or staff. Each spell has its required components written.</p>
					
					<p><b> Casters and Rituals</b> : Casters may use their own magic points to cast the spell up to their own maximum, and then continue the 
					ritual from that point on. However, the allocated time is still calculated.</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><i>If a caster wants to cast a 5 magic point spell, (which would
					be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 hours), and they add 3 of their own magic points within which would remove the first three points (1, 2 and 3), and
					the remaining time for the ritual would be 9(4+5) hours.</i></p>
					
					<p><b>Multiple Ritualists</b> : For every additional participant in a ritual, reduce the time required by 1 hour
					to a minimum of 1/10th of its original time.
					<p style="text-align:center;"><i> A 6 hour ritual with two participants would reduce it to 5 hours while with three
					participants it would be reduced to 4 hours. Such a ritual could technically be brought down to
					~ 30 minutes (being 1/10th the time for 6 hours rounded to the nearest 30 minute increment).</i></p>
					
					<p><b>Feedback</b> : Any ritual or spell cost that is greater than 3 times the caster's total magic point pool has an ever increasing chance of 
					killing them. Every hour, roll a die per mana higher than the caster's magic pool. Each die that rolls a 4+ makes the caster take 1 
					Lethal point of damage. Should the original caster die due to the Feedback, the next main "caster" is chosen randomly or by any who step up. 
					The ritual now checks if the ritual is 3 times their total magic point pool and the process repeats.<p>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Non-casters attempting a ritual are considered to have a magic point pool of 0 and can cast 
					rituals of up to 3 magic points without feedback.</i></p>
