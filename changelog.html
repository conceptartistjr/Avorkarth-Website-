<h3> AVORKARTH CHANGELOG</h3>

<h4>NEWS/CHANGES</h4>

<h3>8th Apr. 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>World Lore/Timeline</b>
<br> -- Added dates to each point of the timeline for prior to creation as well as the
first two ages.
<br> -- Further detailed much of the first two ages and creation, starting to consider for the many civilizations
of importance in the 5th age of Avorkarth, as well as fixing plot holes.
<br> -- Added a new painting to the timeline.
<br> -- Added extra details and a 9th version of the World Map to better show the added parts
of the timeline.

<!--
<h3>X Mar 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<br>These changes were all done with feedback from the newer systems. It was mostly positive,
and a lot was simpler to grasp and use, but there were still too many complications for my
liking.
<b>Rulebook : Combat</b>
<br> -- Split armour values for all armours to match the weaponry. (Slice/Pierce/Crush).
<br> -- Changed how weaponry reacts with strength for might. Crushing weapons add to 
the user's strength (reverting to the old system).
Slicing weapons and piercing weapons gain minor bonuses, but are set numbers 
(keeping to the new system). -- TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT!
-->

<h3>11th Mar 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
<br> -- Added 3 more rough pages for Chapter 2.

<h3>7th Mar 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook : Ability Scores/Combat Attributes</b>
<br> -- Reworked the wounds/health system for all creatures. Wounds are now split into
"Wounds", "Lesser Wounds" and "Minor Wounds". These all heal at different rates, with wounds
not healing unless specified.
<br> -- Reworked non-lethal damage/wounding system to better match the new Wound system.
<br> -- Reworked how combat damage is dealt, removing the idea of size differences and 
toughness, instead, damage is now simply dealt, with bonuses given for the differnce in 
creature's strengths. (So that a fairy punching a giant doesn't really do much.)
<br> -- Reworked Natural Armour, it being a special talent instead of being based on 
a creature's constitution score.
<br><b>Rulebook : Combat</b>
<br> -- Reworked the initiative and action system so that a creature's agility and instinct
are more independant instead of being squished into a single score. Agility is how often
a creature can act in a round, while instinct is now how quickly they act 
compared to other creatures.
<br> -- Removed a few variation of interaction timers (Free/Immediate Actions).
<br> -- Rewrote the rules to enacting combat to fit the new initiative and action systems.
<br><b>Rulebook : Weapons/Armour</b>
<br> -- Reworked all of the weapons' damage and might, and changing how weapon types
have changed. (This is most probably a temporary fix. It works for now, but I will be looking
into these systems more in the near future.)
<br> --  Armours are much stronger as with the removal of toughness,
a creature's Constitution doesn't increase armour values at all anymore.
I also changed the weapon breaking system to function better with might instead of damage. (Due 
to the changes in the wound systems.)
</p>

<h3>2nd Feb 2023</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Worldlore : Creatures</b>
<br> -- Rewrote part of the Hiran/Centaur page, as it was obviously written while very tired last time.
<br><b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
<br> -- Added the roughs for the first 13 pages of Chapter 2! Slowly but surely.
</p>

<h3>13th Dec 2022</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Worldlore : Creatures / Website</b>
<br> -- Updated the world map to V9. This change is to make the realm more human-centric and low-fantasy, with elder
races and species to the east and with smaller lands, and the west as the human versus human medieval age. This makes
the myths and legends of Avorkarth not something often seen by most humans.
<br><b>Worldlore : Creatures / Website</b>
<br> -- Redesigned the creatures page to make it more visual. Each species will now have
paintings as their "button", instead of simple text. Many of them still don't have
descriptions, details or stats.
<br> -- Added over twenty new artworks for the creature species.
<br> -- Updated many creatures with TBDs, as I'm still unhappy with how a few stats/rules work. They'll
be updated once I've found solutions.
</p>

beauty.

<h3>2nd May 2022</h3>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook</b>
<br> -- Changed the rules of Parry, making it a choice alongside dodge, as well as
a result of a partial hit. This was due to armour applying too high a penalty
to dodge, making heavily armoured characters unable to ever use shields or parry.
<br> -- Added wounds as a base physical ability score.
<br> -- Split the physical ability score into two. Physical and Essential.
<br> -- Re-instated the increase/decrease of ability scores due to the changes I'm

more cleaned version. Testing image selection with html.

to half-image / text.
<br> -- Moved Equipment into the Rulebook from World Lore.
<br> -- Updated the armour rules to change it from being just another roll on
top of Dodge. Armour now degrades as damage is averted, making equipment quality
more important and stacking armour less powerful. It was too easy to become invincible.

for damage is now increased or decreased based on weapon size and the difference between Might and Armour.
<br> : Constitution no longer affects wounds, but affects instead a new stat, stamina, which is how many turns

<b>Website</b>

    easier to change down the road and to have consistency throughout the website.
    Please note that a lot of the website has now slightly broken in terms of placing,
    but is still fully functional.
<br><b>Rulebook</b>
<br> -- The rulebook has been massively updated from simple photoshop images to
    fully hi-lightable and searchable text. A lot of it needs further tweaking
    and placing, but it was put together to keep the same feel as the original
    images. (The background image'll be redone to function with the new text placing.)
    The text also makes the website much smaller and faster to load.

<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook</b>
<br> -- (Not yet fully implemented) - Removing Tier bonuses from Ability Scores
    and going through the process of removing Tiers from the ruleset/rulebook.
    I'll be looking into changing Carry Weight rules to function with the removal
    of Tiers. Everything should function simply off of the character's ability
    scores and talents and the rest has been changed accordingly.
<br> -- Updated Wounds : Constitution/2 + 1 --> Constitution
<br> -- Updated Ranged Attacks : Dexterity --> (Dexterity + Instinct)/2
<br> -- Updated Might : Strength/2 + Str tier --> Strength
<br> -- Updated Natural Armour : Talents only --> Constitution/3
<br> -- Updated Damage : Talents only --> Strength/3
<br> -- Updated the Presence bonus of Beauty characters : (Bea + Con + Will)/3 - 1
    (Bea + Will)/2. I also updated it so that only strength based presences are
    used for enemy resolve calculations.
<br> -- Updated the number of Actions per turn to function simply as a basis of
    each 4 agility. (See combat section for more details).
<br><b>World Lore</b>
<br> -- Updated the world map with cleaner text and additional locations. Descriptions to come.
<br> -- Lowered the horse agility and instinct ability scores by 1. They were a bit too powerful.

<br> -- Updated the Presence rule to add availability to Beauty characters,
    though to a lesser extent.
<br> -- Reworked the Parry rule : Str/3 + Dex/3 + 1 -- Str/3 + Dex/4. The parry
    bonus was too high, I wanted shields to provide the greater boost and parry
    to be a slight boost.
<br><b>Character Sheet</b>
<br> -- The character sheet is currently being reworked into Version 8 to function
    with all the changes the main rework of the rulebook brought. For those wishing
    to make characters, version 7 is still available and mostly up to date on the
    tabs at the bottom of the character sheet.

<br> -- Updated the example Karthian ability scores on page 3 to match the lore version.
<br><b>World Lore </b>
<br> -- Replaced the world map with the most current (and hopefully final) version.
    Minor changes all around to make the mainland bigger, as it is the core of the realm.
    Made oceans and waterways more relevant and changed it so that the further
    lands are harder to access but closer together. Overall, I'm really happy

<br> -- Redid the World Lore main page and acess to make it easier to read and
    cleaner to navigate.
<br> -- Removed the creature list with the intent of cleaning it up and making

    There'll be changes to the rules for this version (as always).
<br><b>Website</b>
<br> -- The rulebook has been separated in two, one based on images for the

<h4>16 December 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.7</b>
<br> -- Redid all of the class talents from the ground up so that they function
    according to the current system of rules.
<br> -- The magic class talents have returned as well, now that the magic system
    has been tested to sort of work.
<br> -- Removed all of the general talents. They are now incorporated into their
    respective classes.
<br> -- The talents categories have also been removed. I'm going to make them
    into racial/faction based classes down the line instead. This will be in the
    lorebook as I want the rulebook to simply be for the ruleset and base characters.
    Anything beyond will be extra. So for now, the Ranger, Knight, Thief and Maven
    classes have been removed.
</p>

<h4>8 December 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.6</b>
<br> -- Now that the systems are working as I like, I returned to the simpler d6.
    Luckily, with the current systems this changes
    next to nothing other than making it easier for players to remember the chart.
<br> -- Skills - Minor tweaks to a few, still trying to make travelling a more
    enjoyable thing. (Survival!!!)
<br> -- Added the new Narei art piece!! Two to go!
<br> -- Although there are no changes to this yet, I'm still looking at numbers.
    It'll take time.
<br><b>Tale</b>
<br> -- Uploaded the first test of all the prologue pages. (They're sketchy,
    mostly to see if it works on other computers as intended.)
</p>

<h4>1 December 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.5.3</b>
<br> -- Minor tweaks to numbers for...
<br> -- Skills - Although the mastery numbers were almost perfect, I changed
    a few adventuring skills like survival to
make it less frustrating for average and lesser characters.
<br> -- Mastery - The numbers were a bit off for combat masteries.
    I also made it into player choice over rules, although
kept the old chart should players be unsure.
<br> -- Equipment qualities - Mostly a bit too high damage from stuff still.
<br> -- I also merged weapon proficiency into the mastery system, so as to have
    it all in one place.
</p>

<h4>25 November 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.5.2</b>
<br> -- Experimental Finish! (Ish) -- I've finally finished the update for what
    I was going for, making the entire game playable off of a single dice rolling chart!
    The idea is complexity through choice, not through rules... There are still a ton of
rules though.
<br> -- Removed the ability score scores, turning it into tiers alone.
<br> -- Updated the attribute sections to function with ability tiers alone.
<br> -- Made combat a bit more deadly, reducing the numbers further down (including health)!
<br> -- Hit points have been removed, although non-lethal damage remains.
<br> -- The equipment types and weaponry have been rewritten so that they function
    with the new dice rolling system.
<br> -- Updated how actions per turn function.
</p>

<h4>23 November 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.5.1</b>
<br> -- Removed the racial Core Attributes.
<br> -- Minor changes to all numberings, mostly the ability score section.
<br> -- Added base/minimum damage, for the lesser strengths.
<br> -- Added the Minimum Value rule to dice rolls.
<br> -- Added the size difference rule for equipment as well as attack values and damages.
</p>

<h4>20 November 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.5</b>
<br> -- Finished up the rest of the experimental update, with a few changes from the 9.4 test.
<br> -- -- Updates from the 9.4 test --
<br> -- Changed the wording for Ability Score to Ability Tier and Ability Value
    to Ability Score. This will hopefully make the values more understandable.
<br> -- Updated the dice rolling table to be slightly easier to use by removing
    the two categories that included flat numbering. Now it is simply greater or
    lesser, then doubled and tripled/halved and one-third(ed?).
    Any higher is considered an auto fail/success.
<br> -- Reworked the health/hit point formlae to bring it in line with the rest
    of the experimental 9.4 updates.
<br> -- Updated the skill, attack and dodge numbers to be +5 instead of +10.
    The numbers were a bit too high.
<br> -- -- Additional Changes (Finishing touches) --
<br> -- Removed the Combat Level system, replacing it with a Mastery system
    that would work for combat AND skills.
<br> -- Moved the weapon Proficiency to the new Mastery system.
<br> -- The Skills have been fully updated (long since needed for many versions)
    as to work with the most current methods.
<br> -- The Equipment listings have been updated as well to function with the
    new space mechanics.
<br> -- The Weapons have been updated as well, increasing damage dealt to better
    function with the greater health. (The disparity of health/damage is still
    in favour of health however.)
<br> -- The metal quality has been moved to the end of equipment.
    Hopefully makes reading it all easier.
<br> -- The might bonuses have now been shifted into the classes.
<br> -- Moved the Overview section into Character Creation.
<br> -- Added the Dice Rolls section.
<br> -- Added additional Special Combat Rules.
<br> -- Removed Swiftness from Attributes and readded it as a lesser section in
    Actions, so as to not have two seperate sections to look
at while calculating actions per turn.
<br><b> Website Changes </b>
<br> -- Moved the Interactions sections before the Character Creation,
    to incentivize people to learn the rules before heading
blindly into the game.
<br> -- Added the Dice Rolls section into the interactions section to make the
    table easier to find, and to add a few details.
<br> -- Moved the Skills section to Interactions to equalize it with Combat and
    Actions as valid ways of succeeding at adventuring.
<br><b> Still to be done </b>
<br> -- Talents will be updated next, they require a bit more thinking to function
    with all other rule changes.
<br> -- Still have to add racial age changes, including bonuses and penalties.
<br> -- Relook at spell effects and numbers. The rules themselves are fine.
<br> -- Update the character sheet to work in the new rules.
</p>

<h4>10 November 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.4</b>
<br> -- LARGE UPDATE! (Experimental!) -- Still working on it.
<br> -- Avorkarth has returned to using 10 sided dice, just like a much earlier
    version. This allow a slight bit more of variety from actions and a bit more
    randomality. It also allows for percentages to be rolled with a lot more ease
    than 6 sided die (Using two 10-sided die).
<br> -- Ability scores are being changed, basically changing the game's ruleset
    from the ground up number wise. This was necessary the more I worked on the
    beastiary, as the base numbers were too low/small to allow for much variety.
    The new system is a return to numbers having assigned values. (Although the
    exact value may still be chosen by the player.) This means that the base number
    of a stat is its categorization instead of its value. So two creatures with
    category 9 Strength may still have different values on their rolls, it simply
    denotes the approximate minimum or maximum of said value.
<br> -- Rewrote parts of the Overview and re-organized it to better fit the
    rulebook's overall structure.
<br> -- Attributes have been rewritten to match the new ability scores,
    and most score calculations haved been simplified, making it much
    easier to figure out most attributes. Some now play off of the
    character's age now as well.
<br> -- Some of these Attributes include : Health/Hit, Attack Values,
    Dodge/Directional Dodge, Initiative, Swiftness, Weapon proficiencies,
    Wounding and Linguistics.
<br> -- The carrying space attribute has finally been figured out and added.
    (Although equipment is currently being revised first.)
<br> -- The parry/block mechanic has been added.
<br> -- Removed the Might section and all bonuses given by such section.
    All the bonuses will be shifted directly into the classes.
<br> -- Lore change update. I've spent time thinking of it, and have directly
    changed humans. The Thrakaens are now their own race/species. Humanity
    shares an equal ability score, the variants differentiated simply by racial talents.
<br> -- Updated the Hit Table in the Combat section to work with the 10 sided
    dice system. It has now been placed in the Actions
page.
<br> -- Updated the Skills to function with the 10 sided dice system. Note that
    not all skills are finished for this change.
<br><b> -- Upcoming additional Changes soon-ish -- </b>
<br> -- Update the skill effects. Add a counter to skill DCs.
<br> -- Update the equipment listings, rules and numbers so that it functions
    with the new d10 system.
<br> -- Update the racial and class talents so that they function with the new
    d10 system and attribute changes.
<br> -- Shift the Might bonuses to the classes.
<br> -- Overhaul the Combat Level system so that it functions properly with the
    new d10 system and ability score increases.
</p>

<h4>28 October 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Tale</b>
<br> -- Coded a test version of a simple reader for the tale section without the
    use of any javascript. (I'm currently trying to stay away from that due to
    my time being consumed enough as it is on all the facets of this project.)
<br><b>Website</b>
<br> -- Added a small gap at the bottom of the index page so that the scrolling
    doesn't mess up anymore.
</p>

<h4>27 October 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.3.1</b>
<br> -- Updated the carrying capacity rules to match the semi-exponential growth
    of stats. Still trying to make each +1 to an ability score to really matter.
<br> -- Added the new Runnoc artwork!
</p>

<h4>20 October 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.3</b>
<br> -- Changed the 5 feet calculations to the equivalent of 1 Tile (EXCEPT SKILLS
    - they are to be rewritten soonish). All range calculations will now be done
     by tile instead of feet. This should make things easier to rule check.
<br> -- Updated the scaling of most Ability Scores and Attributes so that higher
    ability scores grow in semi-exponentially power.
<br> --- Reworked swiftness and agility scaling into a singluar thing (swiftness),
    as the double-stacking bonuses of agility were a bit too strong.
<br> --- Updated how health and hit points function to scale much higher with
    greater numbers.
<br> --- Added the Abyssal language and updated all language costs, as well as
    increasing the intelligence bonus to languages.
<br> --- Changed how Initiative is calculated to give Instinct a higher priority.
<br> -- Updated the actions section to be more in tune with the newer combat rules.
<br> -- Revisited the Size category section and updated the rules to function
    with the changes made prior reflected in combat.
<br> -- Added a bleeding out state if the unconscious stage is reached with
    lethal damage. Added a heal check to it.
<br> -- Updated weapon damage again, reducing overall damage and further
    reducing ranged damage. Moved unarmed weaponry to Attributes.
<br> -- Changed how many standard actions characters gets in a turn and added
    a free move action for all characters.
<br> -- Made silver coins into their own category, between copper/iron and gold.
<br> -- Added weapon proficiency to the attribute section.
<br> -- Updated the fear and charm effects to differentiate themselves a tiny
    bit more from each other.
<br> -- Updated the Level Bonuses to match the more recent combat rules.
<br> -- Removed some of the Class Talents that weren't working with character
    choice or the current ruleset. (General talents mostly).
<br><b>Website</b>
<br> -- Changed the naming convention for the tabs, so its easier to track
    when hovering over them.
</p>

</p>

<br> -- Added the Faction and Creatures section, filling them with my current
    creations of lore and creature types. No details at the moment.
<br><b>Website</b>
<br> -- Added another main section for campaigns under the surprisingly original
    naming of Campaigns.
<br> -- Changed Lore to World Lore.
</p>

<h4>22 September 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.2.1</b>
<br> -- Modified the numbers on the weapons so that rolling a 6 is always the
    best option, or if anything at least as good as a 4/5.
<br> -- Updated the equipment qualities to scale properly as well, making rolls
    of 6 always the best option as well. (Thanks to Ceru for pointing this out).
</p>

<h4>20 September 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.2</b>
<br> -- Merged all base spellcaster classes into one, the Adept. This'll make it
    easier down the line to separate the caster types.
<br> -- Added a new base adventuring class, the scholar! For those who prefer an
    intellectual approach to things.
<br><br><b>Character Sheet v.5</b>
<br> -- Updated the Character Sheet to version 5!!
<br> -- Changed the link to the character sheet to automatically ask to make a copy,
    instead of having a bunch of steps. (Thank you to BinaryChaos for letting me know!)
<br><br><b>Website Update</b>
<br> -- Fixed the rulebook image link on the main page of the site.
</p>

<h4>18 September 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.1</b>
<br> -- Re-added the might section so as to finalize the last section that
    I wanted to re-add with 0.9. Yay!
<br> -- Minor changes to the combat level approximation to reduce the power
    level of the general populace and make heroic figures truly heroic.
<br> -- Added the Daelden racial image to the Races section.
<br><br><b>Lore/Tale Update</b>
<br> -- Added blank pages for Lore and Tale sections so that the buttons actually
    go somewhere and are tested.
<br><br><b>Website Update</b>
<br> -- Restructured the website for future holdings of Lore and Tale sections.
    (Rulebook is now compartmentalized within its own folder instead of everything
    being a single root folder.)
<br> -- Added a base page for the Rulebook with links to all of its parts.
<br> -- Changed the code to have proper tab titles and indexes for those who love
    having many tabs open at once.
<br> -- Added the link to Patreon on the sidebar.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.9 - 7 September 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Re-added the magic section! With this the base rules are done, although
    there will still be loads of tweaking and testing.
<br> -- Updated the base magic class talents to function with the new way spells are.
<br> -- Fixed the Narei race description so that they aren't Runnocs anymore.
<br> -- Updated the weapon and material numbers to make them deadlier at base,
    and less of an upgrade with materials. It also will add to the power of magical weapons.
<br> -- Updated critical hits once again. I think I like where it is now,
    but considering how often I've updated this rule...
</p>

<h4> Version 0.8.3 - 29 August 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Reworked how Skills are buffed, removing all Skill points and replacing
    them with checkboxes of "Skilled" and "Trained". This further enforces the
     nerf I wanted for dice rolls going too high and ability scores mattering more.
<br> -- Changed a few ability scores for the races, equally buffing instinct
    and nerfing will and bringing them closer to what I want lore-wise.
<br> -- Fixed Thrakaens' image in the race section.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.8.2 - 28 August 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Added the logo to the front page
<br> -- Added the Xia image to the Xia race.
<br> -- Rewrote all CSS back code for the website as to make it easier for future
    edits and cleanups of major code sections.
<br> -- Thanks to the code rewrites, all boxes for text locations have been hidden
    to make the website a bit cleaner.
<br> -- Moved and merged any and all sections of magic from Attributes to
    Spellcasting. Then removed them entirely for now. (Kept
as note.)
<br> -- Removed all three ability scores that were attributed to Spellcasting.
    They are now attached to the type of caster the character is.
<br> -- Rewrote the Will checks (now named Resolve) at the end of each combat
    round as to make Presence useful for combat as well.
<br> -- Updated the racial pages to be cleaner and easier to follow with the Character sheets.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.8.1 - 15 August 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Updated the Ability Scores section by separating it into new sections :
    Action, Mind, Social, Leadership and Attunement.
<br> -- Re-added the Magic Ability Scores of Devotion, Arcana and Spirit under Attunement.
<br> -- Updated the Character Sheet to version 4.2 with all the 0.8 rule changes.
    It is now formatted to be printable for those who prefer pencil and paper!
</p>

<h4> Version 0.8 - 13 August 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
<b><u>THOUGHTS/REASONINGS</u></b>
<br> -- I decided to make these changes after playing the first campaign playtest
    with a few friends. I noticed that the dice rolls were too high for the most
    part from the human races as to what I wanted the dice rolls to be.
    The intent behind the creation of Avorkarth was to get away from abilities
    and attack values of ridiculous proportions that have slowly increased in
    Pathfinder and DnD. The power level attained by humans in the test was a bit
    too high for my liking. This is especially due to the fact that I haven't
    yet released the upper class talents that are supposed to increase the few
    characters to that point of power. This update is for that reason,
    hoping to reduce everything and continue the idea that even getting +1 in
    something is a substantial power-up.
<br>Magic is also a bit too convoluted to be easily used by players, and I have
    begun thinking of a better system that'll still keep the idea of magic being
    rare but powerful as well as separating types of casters. It'll be the focus
    of my next update.
<br>
<br><b><u> CHANGES </u></b>
<br> -- Critical hits have been removed entirely, now reflected instead in the
    weapon damage system. This is further reflected in talents, equipment and
    combat rules. Likewise, critical wounds have been reworked to function as this
    game's version of critical hits.
<br> -- Most magic is going to need to be re-thought and therefore the spellcasting
    system as it is is going to disappear. The full rework will be in a future update.
    (There's a <i>lot</i> of rebalancing needed).
<br> -- All magic point types have been changed on how the amount of
    mana/energy/reverence per ability score function.
<br> -- The Devotion/Arcana/Spirit Ability Scores have been removed from the races.
<br> -- Caster levels/rankings have been added as a start to the change of how
    spellcasting works.
<br> -- Overall damage has been redone and strength bonuses are reduced so that
    most average creatures are no longer one-shot,
    but are still in mortal danger whenever combat occurs.
<br> -- The Ability Score system has been re-evaluated, with humans and other
    more common adventuring races becoming weaker overall and the allowance of
    negative scores in the Ability Score.
<br> -- Added a third ability score section, replacing the magic one.
    Charisma and Beauty have been moved to the Social section, alongside with a
    new ability score called Presence.
<br> -- Added a new natural skill called Inspire for Presence.
<br> -- All health pools have been slightly increased, allowing for minor errors
    during combat. Combat is still rather quickly lethal, and most characters
    will still die in two to three hits in equal combat.
<br> -- Many attributes related to Ability Scores have been rewritten due to the
    overall purge of power, keeping them relatively the same as to how they used
    to be pre-purge. (Carry weight, Languages, etc...)
<br> -- Many class talents were redone (due to the changes and also to weaken
    the general, adventurer and elite talents a bit.) I have currently skipped
    all the magic ones.
<br> -- Weapon damage has been redone in accordance to the Ability Score system
    changes, with the weapon type changing how damage functions. The split has
    been mostly between crushing weapons and slicing/piercing weapons'
    dependencies on strength.
<br> -- Weapon/Armour materials were redone as well to compensate for the
    overall nerfing.
<br> -- Updated how Skill points function, their penalties and the points
    allowed within, lowering the maximum bonus to dice rolls.
<br> -- Updated the Attack/Dodge chart in combat, due to the overall
    Ability Score lowering.
<br> -- Updated the additional Actions per Turn from Agility bonuses in combat,
    making it even harder to gain alongside the ability score lowering.
    Now pretty much only attainable through combat levels and talents for
    most common races.
<br> -- Changed a few of the lower material values, making them more usable
    while still costing way less.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.4.2 - 1 August 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Minor changes to carry weight in association to movement.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.4.1 - 31 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Changes to how initative is calculated. Rolls no longer apply,
    it is purely a number now. Updated the combat and attributes sections
    to reflect this.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.4 - 30 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Slight changes to how immediate actions are gained.
<br> -- Added non-lethal attacks as a special combat rule.
<br> -- Changed the way Critical Hits and Critical Wounds function.
<br> -- Changed the Rough/Good/Perfect rule to now function for Swimming and Flying.
<br> -- Updated the character sheet to auto-complete any non-changeable sections.
    (Still might need more work).
<br> -- Added a minor change to the 1 level gain to be health AND hit points now.
<br> -- Changed the method of noting range on melee weapons so as to not confuse
    melee and range.
<br> -- Added a spirit based class and basic 0 cost spirit spells.
<br> -- Found a few more typos.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.3.3 - 28 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Added the painting for the Thrakan race portrait.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.3.2 - 27 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Minor change for Combat levels, Hit Point per level to Health Point per level.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.3.1 - 21 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Minor changes to race heights, considerations done as I was painting them.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.3 - 17 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Changed the Skills a bit, making them lower overall so to keep numbers
    consistent by adding a penalty to both Natural and Learned skills. Learned
    skill still take an additional penalty if they have no skill points within.
<br> -- The Knowledge skills have been completely redone and rethought, though
    are similar in function. They now function just like the Learned and Natural
    skills but with an overarching ruling.
<br> -- Updated the character sheet to reflect these minor changes.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.2 - 16 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Reworked the Free/Immediate/Swift action rules again, making it harder
    to have more non-standard actions. They now function based on the additional
    actions instead of the base.
<br> -- Changed the equipment descriptions of light and heavy crossbows to better
    match the actions descriptions.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7.1 - 14 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Reworked the Armour Values calculations and changed a few armour piece values.
<br> -- Added a description and rule for the value of each armour type
    (Natural - Full - Guarded).
<br> -- Added a rule for Guarded armour, which makes it that it can only reduce
    damage to a certain minimum based upon the Full armour value. (Armour values
    were too high too easily for their intended purpose of reducing damage,
    instead of negating it completely).
<br> -- Changed the Arcane Prowess of the Adept talents to better match the rest
    of the class talents, considering Spell DCs are much rarer now.
<br> -- Reduced the Xia base Spirit to 0(1).
<br> -- Added a painting for the Tildran race.
</p>

<h4> Version 0.7 - 9 July 2020</h4>
<p class="note">
     -- Might completely removed as a section from the manual.
<br> -- Might is now fully class/level related, removing much of the unnecessary
    complications and "feature creep".
<br> -- Ability score points are now an individual choice instead of a rule,
    making it easier to create the wanted character. This does not change the
    fact that all races and creatures are limited by a potential/peak ability score.
<br> -- Added an approximation of appropriate ability score point spending upon
    character creation as a guideline.
<br> -- Skills are also now limited to their absolute highest based upon the
    relevant ability score.
<br> -- Updated the character sheet to a cleaner and better version.
    Thank you to Paul Ruest for revising the sheet and offering great ideas.
<br> -- Created an Alignment section in overview, making it mesh better with the
    character creation process tabs.
<br> -- Changed/Split the Attack Bonuses to Attack Value and Wounding.
    They are no longer affected by ability scores, instead now being their own
    thing. This makes it easier to affect with class talents.
<br> -- Removed all ability score bonuses from the base Class talents and
    removed the mythical bonuses. Ability score bonuses are instead changed
    to variants of skills and combat abilities.
<br> -- Reduced the potential of many races to align with this change in how
    ability scores are calculated.
<br> -- Changed the race's function to class talents by adding ability score
    requirements, so that certain races (lookin' at you falgrii) cannot access
    the more powerful ones and so that the lore stays consistent.
<br> -- Updated how health and hit points are regained, making keeping health
    points and avoiding combat when possible even more important.
<br> -- Added rules for the Dodge defense, adding the Front, Flank and Back.
    (Useful for assassins and group combat!)
<br> -- Changed weapon damage type keyword Bludgeoning to Crushing.
<br> -- Added damage ranges for weapons, removing the dice bonus and making it
    a bit less random.
<br> -- Changed the interaction of Hit/Dodge, making it simpler to use and taking
    inspiration from Warhammer 40k rules.
<br> -- Added new special combat actions to allow positioning countering.
<br> -- Separated Magic bonuses from any and all physical and instinctual ability
    scores. Updated attributes as well to reflect this change.
<br> -- Changed how spell difficulty checks are made. Now on a per spell basis IF required.
<br> -- Rewrote Eonna's basic spell listing to match the new ability score changes as well.
<br> -- Added 5 Arcana casting examples for those who wish to test out a spellcaster
    with the rulebook alone. (These will probably change)
<br> -- Added the base Adept class for those same reasons and for characters to be able to cast.
<br> -- Cleared many typos and phrasing issues. (Although I'm certain there are
    still some lurking around!)
</p>

    Eonna. (Probably will change.)
<br> -- Removed the Adept adventurer class for the core classes. Will re-add it

a special class than a core class. Kept the Vessel class, but only for a basic
    variant of chosen that serve Eonna for the core rulebook.
