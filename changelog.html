				<h3 style="text-align:center;"> AVORKARTH CHANGELOG</h3>

				<h4 style="text-align:center;">NEWS/CHANGES</h4>

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">24 June 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
				<br> -- Chapter 0 : Cleaned up page 3 and redid page 2.

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">21 June 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>Adventures</b>
				<br> -- Changed the folder systems to better accomodate multiple adventures.
				<br><b>Adventures : Pass of Radell</b>
				<br> -- Finally added fully painted Tokens! The Adventure is ready to go!
				<br> -- Added an easy method of downloading the Tokens on the DM page.
				<br> -- Fixed some spelling and telling mistakes. (Hair is no longer in Olfred's description to match the painting I did.)
				<br> -- Removed the world location map for now... More world building to do first.
				<br><b>Adventures : The Sunrise Inn</b>
				<br> -- Added the introductory page for The Sunrise Inn
				
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">17 June 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>Index Page</b>
				<br> -- Added a new painting to the renown page.
				<br><b>Worldlore : Timeline</b>
				<br> -- Fixed a lore issue that had persisted from earlier drafts. The creation of the ancient beings(spirits, angels, reapers etc..) is now properly in the First Age (Disharmony).
				<br> -- Moved the Third Age (Mortality) up into about halfway through the Ikkani/Sei'yuulei wars to instead denote the mortality of the realm as well as the Twin Divines' sacrifice. Nothing lore wise changed, just timing.
				<br> -- Added vague "details" to the Fourth/Fifth age of important lore that'll need expanding.
				
				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">14 June 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>Index Page</b>
				<br> -- Recoded the index/main page to theoretically once again fit on phone screens. Sorry 'bout that.
				<br><b>World Lore : Creatures</b>
				<br> -- Reorganized and changed the way creatures are listed.
				<br> -- Added a few creatures to the list, although without links and details.
				<br> -- Added the Thrakaen variation of humanity with stats and details.

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">12 June 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>Character Sheet</b>
				<br> -- Updated the character sheet fully to the newest rule set! Use the version 8 tab.	

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">4 June 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>World Lore</b>
				<br> -- Creatures : Added a new human variant - the Xia!
				<br><b>Tale of the Fifth Age</b>
				<br> -- Changed a few things in the prologue. Still rough and playing with panel ideas and readability.

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">3 June 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>Rulebook</b>
				<br> -- Added a new painting to the rulebook!

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">31 May 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>Rulebook</b>
				<br> -- (Not yet fully implemented) - Removing Tier bonuses from Ability Scores and going through the process of removing Tiers from the ruleset/rulebook. I'll be looking into changing Carry Weight rules to function with the removal of Tiers. Everything should function simply off of the character's ability scores and talents and the rest has been changed accordingly.
				<br> -- Updated Wounds : Constitution/2 + 1 --> Constitution
				<br> -- Updated Ranged Attacks : Dexterity --> (Dexterity + Instinct)/2
				<br> -- Updated Might : Strength/2 + Str tier --> Strength
				<br> -- Updated Natural Armour : Talents only --> Constitution/3
				<br> -- Updated Damage : Talents only --> Strength/3
				<br> -- Updated the Presence bonus of Beauty characters : (Bea + Con + Will)/3 - 1 --> (Bea + Will)/2. I also updated it so that only strength based presences are used for enemy resolve calculations.
				<br> -- Updated the number of Actions per turn to function simply as a basis of each 4 agility. (See combat section for more details).
				<br><b>World Lore</b>
				<br> -- Updated the world map with cleaner text and additional locations. Descriptions to come.
				<br> -- Lowered the horse agility and instinct ability scores by 1. They were a bit too powerful.
				<br> -- Updated the base stats of all creatures to match the rule changes again.
				<br><b>Adventures</b>
				<br> -- <b>The Pass of Radell</b> :
				<br> --- Updated the base stats of the creatures in the campaign to match the rule changes.

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">29 May 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b>Rulebook</b>
				<br> -- Updated the Presence rule to add availability to Beauty characters, though to a lesser extent.
				<br> -- Reworked the Parry rule : Str/3 + Dex/3 + 1 --> Str/3 + Dex/4. The parry bonus was too high, I wanted shields to provide the greater boost and parry to be a slight boost.
				<br><b>Character Sheet</b>
				<br> -- The character sheet is currently being reworked into Version 8 to function with all the changes the main rework of the rulebook brought. For those wishing to make characters, version 7 is still available and mostly up to date on the tabs at the bottom of the character sheet.

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">27 May 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">

				<br><b>Adventures</b>

				<br> --- Updated the lists of items to reflect their metal qualities and current values.
				<br> --- Added held weaponry to each creature.

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">22 May 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">				
				<br><b>Adventures</b>
				<br> -- Art Assets : Added a few more experimental map assets : Cliff walls, cave entrance, broken cart and two general rocks/boulder. (Just testing, they'll probably change and be cleaner later.)

				<br> -- Updated the example Karthian ability scores on page 3 to match the lore version.
				<br><b>World Lore </b>
				<br> -- Replaced the world map with the most current (and hopefully final) version. Minor changes all around to make the mainland bigger, as it is the core of the realm. Made oceans and waterways more relevant and changed it so that the further lands are harder to access but closer together. Overall, I'm really happy with how it looks to function with racial/species lore that I've written.

				<br> -- Removed the creature list with the intent of cleaning it up and making it easier to navigate.

				<p style="margin-top:0;">

				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<b>Website </b>
				<br> -- Re-organized all the folder, file and image names so as to have a much clearer naming convention for the future and keeping it all consistent. (It was getting messy.)
				<br> -- Added/Rewrote web page tab titles so that it's easier to keep track of all open pages.

				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<b>World Lore </b>
				<br> -- Added a rough summary of Avorkarth's first and second ages, those lost to time. While this background lore helps settle the world and understand the lore, any and all parts of it are no longer known to any created player character.
				<br> -- Added the current version (will probably change) of the world map to the front page of Lore.

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">17 March 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<b>Rulebook </b>

				<br> -- Added the 15th page of the new rulebook.

				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<b>Rulebook </b>
				<br> -- Removed the old 8th page (Movement) and shifted all pages downwards by 1. It'll be expanded upon and re-added in the General Actions section later on.
				<br> -- Added a new 11th page to replace the old one (which is now the 10th page)
				<br> -- Added a short story as a little extra. I think I'll be doing more of those in future rulebook pages as to expand upon the world and my
				characters.
				</p>

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">4 March 2021</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<b>Rulebook </b>
				<br> -- Added the 11th page of the cleaned rulebook.
				<br> -- Rewrote much of the 10th page... I was obviously sleepy when I first wrote it.
				<br> -- Painted the image of the 6th page! Size chart is now pretty.
				<br><b>Tale </b>
				<br> -- Changed the layout to be a single long list of images per chapter. It makes it faster to iterate, read and code.
				<br> -- Re-uploaded the 17 prologue pages to test cleaner text. (Still very rough images).
				</p>

				<br> -- The magic class talents have returned as well, now that the magic system has been tested to sort of work.
				<br> -- Removed all of the general talents. They are now incorporated into their respective classes.
				<br> -- The talents categories have also been removed. I'm going to make them into racial/faction based classes down the line
				instead. This will be in the lorebook as I want the rulebook to simply be for the ruleset and base characters. Anything beyond will
				be extra. So for now, the Ranger, Knight, Thief and Maven classes have been removed.

				<br> -- Skills - Minor tweaks to a few, still trying to make travelling a more enjoyable thing. (Survival!!!)

				<br> -- Although there are no changes to this yet, I'm still looking at numbers. It'll take time.

				<br> -- -- Updates from the 9.4 test --
				<br> -- Changed the wording for Ability Score to Ability Tier and Ability Value to Ability Score. This will hopefully make the values
				more understandable.
				<br> -- Updated the dice rolling table to be slightly easier to use by removing the two categories that
				included flat numbering. Now it is simply greater or lesser, then doubled and tripled/halved and one-third(ed?). Any higher is considered
				an auto fail/success.
				<br> -- Reworked the health/hit point formlae to bring it in line with the rest of the experimental 9.4 updates.
				<br> -- Updated the skill, attack and dodge numbers to be +5 instead of +10. The numbers were a bit too high.
				<br> -- -- Additional Changes (Finishing touches) --
				<br> -- Removed the Combat Level system, replacing it with a Mastery system that would work for combat AND skills.
				<br> -- Moved the weapon Proficiency to the new Mastery system.
				<br> -- The Skills have been fully updated (long since needed for many versions) as to work with the most current methods.
				<br> -- The Equipment listings have been updated as well to function with the new space mechanics.
				<br> -- The Weapons have been updated as well, increasing damage dealt to better function with the greater health. (The disparity
				of health/damage is still in favour of health however.)
				<br> -- The metal quality has been moved to the end of equipment. Hopefully makes reading it all easier.
				<br> -- The might bonuses have now been shifted into the classes.
				<br> -- Moved the Overview section into Character Creation. 
				<br> -- Added the Dice Rolls section.
				<br> -- Added additional Special Combat Rules.
				<br> -- Removed Swiftness from Attributes and readded it as a lesser section in Actions, so as to not have two seperate sections to look
				at while calculating actions per turn.
				<br><b> Website Changes </b>
				<br> -- Moved the Interactions sections before the Character Creation, to incentivize people to learn the rules before heading
				blindly into the game.
				<br> -- Added the Dice Rolls section into the interactions section to make the table easier to find, and to add a few details.
				<br> -- Moved the Skills section to Interactions to equalize it with Combat and Actions as valid ways of succeeding at adventuring.
				<br><b> Still to be done </b>
				<br> -- Talents will be updated next, they require a bit more thinking to function with all other rule changes.
				<br> -- Still have to add racial age changes, including bonuses and penalties.

				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<b>Rulebook Version 0.9.4</b>
				<br> -- LARGE UPDATE! (Experimental!) -- Still working on it.
				<br> -- Avorkarth has returned to using 10 sided dice, just like a much earlier version. This allow a slight bit more of variety 
				from actions and a bit more randomality. It also allows for percentages to be rolled with a lot more ease than 6 sided die (Using two 10-sided die).
				<br> -- Ability scores are being changed, basically changing the game's ruleset from the ground up number wise. This was necessary
				the more I worked on the beastiary, as the base numbers were too low/small to allow for much variety. The new system is a return to
				numbers having assigned values. (Although the exact value may still be chosen by the player.) This means that the base number of a
				stat is its categorization instead of its value. So two creatures with category 9 Strength may still have different values on their
				rolls, it simply denotes the approximate minimum or maximum of said value.
				<br> -- Rewrote parts of the Overview and re-organized it to better fit the rulebook's overall structure.
				<br> -- Attributes have been rewritten to match the new ability scores, and most score calculations haved been simplified, making it much
				easier to figure out most attributes. Some now play off of the character's age now as well.
				<br> -- Some of these Attributes include : Health/Hit, Attack Values, Dodge/Directional Dodge, Initiative, Swiftness, Weapon proficiencies,
				Wounding and Linguistics.
				<br> -- The carrying space attribute has finally been figured out and added. (Although equipment is currently being revised first.)
				<br> -- The parry/block mechanic has been added.
				<br> -- Removed the Might section and all bonuses given by such section. All the bonuses will be shifted directly into the classes.
				<br> -- Lore change update. I've spent time thinking of it, and have directly changed humans. The Thrakaens are now their own
				race/species. Humanity shares an equal ability score, the variants differentiated simply by racial talents.
				<br> -- Updated the Hit Table in the Combat section to work with the 10 sided dice system. It has now been placed in the Actions
				page.
				<br> -- Updated the Skills to function with the 10 sided dice system. Note that not all skills are finished for this change.
				<br><b> -- Upcoming additional Changes soon-ish -- </b>
				<br> -- Update the skill effects. Add a counter to skill DCs.
				<br> -- Update the equipment listings, rules and numbers so that it functions with the new d10 system.
				<br> -- Update the racial and class talents so that they function with the new d10 system and attribute changes.
				<br> -- Shift the Might bonuses to the classes.
				<br> -- Overhaul the Combat Level system so that it functions properly with the new d10 system and ability score increases.

				<br> -- Updated the scaling of most Ability Scores and Attributes so that higher ability scores grow in semi-exponentially power.
				<br> --- Reworked swiftness and agility scaling into a singluar thing (swiftness), as the double-stacking bonuses of agility were a bit too strong.
				<br> --- Updated how health and hit points function to scale much higher with greater numbers.

				</p>

				<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;"> Version 0.8 - 13 August 2020</h4><hr style="margin-bottom:0;">
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br><b><u>THOUGHTS/REASONINGS</b></u>
				<br> -- I decided to make these changes after playing the first campaign playtest with a few friends. I noticed that
				the dice rolls were too high for the most part from the human races as to what I wanted the dice rolls to be. The intent behind the creation of 
				Avorkarth was to get away from abilities and attack values of ridiculous proportions that have slowly increased in Pathfinder
				and DnD. The power level attained by humans in the test was a bit too high for my liking. This is especially due to the fact that I haven't
				yet released the upper class talents that are supposed to increase the few
				characters to that point of power. This update is for that reason, hoping to reduce everything and continue the idea that
				even getting +1 in something is a substantial power-up.
				<br>Magic is also a bit too convoluted to be easily used by players, and I have begun thinking of a better system that'll
				still keep the idea of magic being rare but powerful as well as separating types of casters. It'll be the focus of my next update.
				<br>
				<br><b><u> CHANGES </b></u>
				<br> -- Critical hits have been removed entirely, now reflected instead in the weapon damage system. 
				This is further reflected in talents, equipment and combat rules. Likewise, critical wounds have been reworked to function as this
				game's version of critical hits.
				<br> -- Most magic is going to need to be re-thought and therefore the spellcasting system as it is is going to disappear.
				The full rework will be in a future update. (There's a <i>lot</i> of rebalancing needed).
				<br> -- All magic point types have been changed on how the amount of mana/energy/reverence per ability score function.
				<br> -- The Devotion/Arcana/Spirit Ability Scores have been removed from the races.
				<br> -- Caster levels/rankings have been added as a start to the change of how spellcasting works.
				<br> -- Overall damage has been redone and strength bonuses are reduced so that most average creatures are no longer one-shot,
				but are still in mortal danger whenever combat occurs.
				<br> -- The Ability Score system has been re-evaluated, with humans and other more common adventuring races
				becoming weaker overall and the allowance of negative scores in the Ability Score.
				<br> -- Added a third ability score section, replacing the magic one. Charisma and Beauty have been moved to the 
				Social section, alongside with a new ability score called Presence.
				<br> -- Added a new natural skill called Inspire for Presence.
				<br> -- All health pools have been slightly increased, allowing for minor errors during combat. Combat is still rather quickly lethal, and
				most characters will still die in two to three hits in equal combat.
				<br> -- Many attributes related to Ability Scores have been rewritten due to the overall purge of power, keeping them relatively
				the same as to how they used to be pre-purge. (Carry weight, Languages, etc...)
				<br> -- Many class talents were redone (due to the changes and also to weaken the general, adventurer and elite talents a bit.)
				I have currently skipped all the magic ones.
				<br> -- Weapon damage has been redone in accordance to the Ability Score system changes, with the weapon type changing how
				damage functions. The split has been mostly between crushing weapons and slicing/piercing weapons' dependencies on strength.
				<br> -- Weapon/Armour materials were redone as well to compensate for the overall nerfing.
				<br> -- Updated how Skill points function, their penalties and the points allowed within, lowering the maximum bonus to dice
				rolls.
				<br> -- Updated the Attack/Dodge chart in combat, due to the overall Ability Score lowering.
				<br> -- Updated the additional Actions per Turn from Agility bonuses in combat, making it even harder to gain alongside the ability 
				score lowering. Now pretty much only attainable through combat levels and talents for most common races.
				<br> -- Changed a few of the lower material values, making them more usable while still costing way less.

				like the Learned and Natural skills but with an overarching ruling.

				<br> -- Added a rule for Guarded armour, which makes it that it can only reduce damage to a certain minimum based upon
				the Full armour value. (Armour values were too high too easily for their intended purpose of reducing damage, instead
				of negating it completely).
				<br> -- Changed the Arcane Prowess of the Adept talents to better match the rest of the class talents, considering Spell DCs
				are much rarer now.
				<br> -- Reduced the Xia base Spirit to 0(1).
				<br> -- Added a painting for the Tildran race.

				<br> -- Might removed as a sub-section and remade into a full section of its own, rewrote all sections that were associated alongside.
				-->
				<br> -- Might completely removed as a section from the manual.
				<br> -- Might is now fully class/level related, removing much of the unnecessary complications and "feature creep".
				<br> -- Ability score points are now an individual choice instead of a rule, making it easier to create the wanted character.
				This does not change the fact that all races and creatures are limited by a potential/peak ability score.
				<br> -- Added an approximation of appropriate ability score point spending upon character creation as a guideline.
				<br> -- Skills are also now limited to their absolute highest based upon the relevant ability score.
				<br> -- Updated the character sheet to a cleaner and better version. Thank you to Paul Ruest for revising the sheet and 
				offering great ideas.
				<br> -- Created an Alignment section in overview, making it mesh better with the character creation process tabs.
				<br> -- Changed/Split the Attack Bonuses to Attack Value and Wounding. They are no longer affected by ability scores, instead now
				being their own thing. This makes it easier to affect with class talents.
				<br> -- Removed all ability score bonuses from the base Class talents and removed the mythical bonuses. Ability score 
				bonuses are instead changed to variants of skills and combat abilities.
				<br> -- Reduced the potential of many races to align with this change in how ability scores are calculated.
				<br> -- Changed the race's function to class talents by adding ability score requirements, so that certain races (lookin' at you 
				falgrii) cannot access the more powerful ones and so that the lore stays consistent.
				<br> -- Updated how health and hit points are regained, making keeping health points and avoiding combat when possible even more important.
				<br> -- Added rules for the Dodge defense, adding the Front, Flank and Back. (Useful for assassins and group combat!)
				<br> -- Changed weapon damage type keyword Bludgeoning to Crushing.
				<br> -- Added damage ranges for weapons, removing the dice bonus and making it a bit less random.
				<br> -- Changed the interaction of Hit/Dodge, making it simpler to use and taking inspiration from Warhammer 40k rules.
				<br> -- Added new special combat actions to allow positioning countering.
				<!--
				<br> -- Changed armour values to match the weapon types. Piercing, Crushing, Slashing. Armours have been updated to have three values.
				<br> -- Added weapon values of of Piercing, Crushing and Slashing. Removed the "types" since it was redundant.-->
				<br> -- Separated Magic bonuses from any and all physical and instinctual ability scores. Updated attributes as well to reflect
				this change.
				<br> -- Changed how spell difficulty checks are made. Now on a per spell basis IF required.
				<br> -- Rewrote Eonna's basic spell listing to match the new ability score changes as well.
				<br> -- Added 5 Arcana casting examples for those who wish to test out a spellcaster with the rulebook alone. (These will probably change)
				<br> -- Added the base Adept class for those same reasons and for characters to be able to cast.
				<br> -- Cleared many typos and phrasing issues. (Although I'm certain there are still some lurking around!)

				<br> -- Added first section to spellcasting for Devotion spellcasters following Eonna. (Probably will change.)
				<br> -- Removed the Adept adventurer class for the core classes. Will re-add it into the Lore section down the line as its rarity makes it more
				a special class than a core class. Kept the Vessel class, but only for a basic variant of chosen that serve Eonna for the core rulebook.
				<br> -- Adjusted a few of the General and Adventurer class talents.

				<p style="margin-top:0;">
				<br> -- Added a few General Talents and the base Adventurer Talents to the Class Talents page, allowing for those with
